<p class=Body align=center style='text-align:center'>PREFACE</p>

<p class=Body  >            Someone has remarked that
one of the most dangerous things a people can do is to talk one way and act
another.  I think that this dictum is true in the sense that in so far as a
people does not understand what it is doing, it is apt to make mistakes.  The
peoples of the capitalistic economies always have condoned the government
ownership of some enterprises, and at the same time they have talked generally
as if government ownership were bad in itself.</p>

<p class=Body  >            There is a parallel
situation in economic theory.  So far as I know, almost all economists who have
had occasion to discuss the matter have approved government ownership for some
enterprises and disapproved it for others.  And at the same time they have set
forth a general theory which would seem to say that government ownership, as a
category, is uneconomic.  I have thought for some time that an inquiry into the
problem of government ownership in a capitalistic economy not only should
reveal something further in regard to the forces at play in a problem which the
peoples of capitalistic nations have faced repeatedly but also should throw
some light on the validity of the general theories as such.</p>

<p class=Body  >            I wish to acknowledge the
consideration and attention which every member of the Graduate Faculty of the
Department of Economics of The University of Texas has given me in the course
of my studies which have played a great part in my thinking on this problem. 
Especially, I wish to thank Professors C. E. Ayres and R. H. Montgomery under
whose direction I have made this study.</p>

<p class=Body  >&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body  >            Throughout the development
of modern capitalism, some economic enterprise has been government-owned.  That
is to say, in providing the means of life and experience, some of the items
involved in the process have been owned and some of the processes have been
carried on directly by bodies politic through their duly organized governments.</p>

<p class=Body  >            When capitalistic
organization began to take recognizable shape as the general pattern of the
economy, some economic enterprises already were established as government
functions.  And some of these enterprises have remained under government
ownership while others have been shifted to private ownership.  At the same
time, economic enterprises which were currently owned and operated by private
persons and firms have been shifted to public ownership; and some of these same
enterprises have been shifted back again to private ownership.  On each such
occasion the problem of government ownership in a capitalistic economy has
arisen anew.  The problem has been a perennial one.</p>

<p class=Body  >            Not only have governments
always owned and operated some economic enterprises, but this situation, as
such, has never been regarded by economists as being incompatible with proper
economic arrangement.  No economist ever has taken the position that absolutely
no economic enterprise should be government-owned [2] although the theoretical
formulations of some economists might seem to dictate that position.  From The <u>Wealth
of Nations</u> through the whole of contemporary theory, allowance is made for
the government ownership of certain economic enterprises.  In the main body of
theoretical development, as will be seen, this allowance has been treated more
as a side issue or afterthought or even as a non-economic consideration than as
an integral part of the main body of general economic theory.  But the
allowance always has been made.</p>

<p class=Body  >            Since the problem has
recurred constantly and since the general principles of economic theory are
presumed by people generally to give some logical basis for policy in regard to
economic problems, recourse to economic theory has been taken by both
proponents and opponents each time the problem has arisen, either in its
inclusive form or in its specific application to an individual enterprise.  The
continued irresolution of this perennial problem, even among professional
students of economics, prompted the present writer to examine the general
principles of economic theory to see whether they offer any logical basis for
solving the problem as it presents itself in a capitalistic economy.  A
reexamination on this score seems to be warranted by the importance of the
problem and by the claim to generality on the part of the basic economic
principles.</p>

<p class=Body  >            Although agreement is
unanimous on the bare proposition that government ownership has a necessary and
proper place in capitalistic economies, great diversity of opinion usually
appears [3] when the alternative patterns of the ownership of a particular
enterprise are brought into question.</p>

<p class=Body  >            Then the pertinent
question becomes: What are the differences between the enterprises upon which
there is disagreement?  Are the differences purely “political,” or are there
economic factors antecedent to the immediate political operations that specify
the pattern of ownership?  If there are antecedent economic factors, do they
have any recognizable pattern?  And if there is a visible pattern, what is the
impellent relationship between the economic factors and the political factors?</p>

<p class=Body  >            Manifestly, all of the
data related to these questions cannot be considered within the limitations
necessarily imposed on the present study.  It is necessary therefore to select
the available area of data that promises to be most remunerative in displaying
evidences on the question.  The area selected for the present study is composed
of six enterprises which have become government-owned in the United States.</p>

<p class=Body  >            An examination of these
data should be useful in furthering a positive solution of the problem of
government ownership; for, if there is pattern to whatever differences are
found to exist between enterprises which have become government-owned and
enterprises which have remained privately owned, a theory of government
ownership in capitalistic economy may be indicated.  An inquiry into such
differences may serve also as a referential check for economic theory in terms
of general applicability.</p>

<p class=Body  >            [4]  The present study,
then, seeks an answer to the following question:  What are the determinants of
government ownership in a capitalistic economy?</p>

<p class=Body  >&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body  >&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body align=center style='text-align:center'>Delimitations of the Study</p>

<p class=Body  >&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body  >            It may be noted that the
question for this study is framed so as to exclude the question of alternative
economic systems.  The study is not concerned with one economic system <u>versus</u>
another for the entire economy.  Rather, it is concerned with what determines a
particular pattern of ownership for particular enterprises in a system in which
there are numerous patterns of ownership and in which those patterns are
changing.  This is not to say that the study disregards the consequences to the
remainder of the economy of the private or government ownership of a particular
enterprise.  Quite the contrary.  The interdependence of the economy,
especially the American economy, precludes the consequences of changing the
pattern of ownership in one enterprise being restricted to that enterprise. 
But, again, this does not involve the question of alternative systems for the
entire economy.  If the problem in fact concerned alternative inclusive
systems, then the problem under consideration in this study could not exist at
all.</p>

<p class=Body  >            Restricting the study to
the determinants of government ownership has several advantages.  It avoids
many complexities of the various ownership patterns which are constantly
changing [5] and which overlap at many points.  And, at the same time, it may
serve as a case study in the general problem of ownership pattern.  Ownership,
as an institution, has developed so many variations that even to describe them
in much detail would be beyond the possibilities of a single study.  Of all the
types of ownership the government-ownership category is probably the most
nearly specific and definite.  It denotes complete and exclusive legal
control.  Some degree of legal control is connected in any pattern of ownership
but in no instance is it complete except when vested in a sovereign government.</p>

<p class=Body  >            Six enterprises are
included in the present study.  Their selection is based on the following
criteria: (1) that they are clearly government-owned, (2) that data concerning
them are available, and (3) that they represent as divergent physical processes
as possible.  Attention is focused on data which are common to all or most of
the enterprises selected under the three listed criteria, and these data are
considered in terms of any sort of pattern which they may present.</p>

<p class=Body align=center style='text-align:center'>Organization of the Study</p>

<p class=Body align=center style='text-align:center'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body  >            The organization of the
study follows directly from what has been said in orientation.</p>

<p class=Body  >            First, the main
developments of economic theory are explored in terms of applicability to the
problem at hand.  Particular attention is paid to the consideration given
directly [6] to the problem by the major spokesmen of the various systems of
economic theory, and their pronouncements on the problem are examined in view
of the general theoretical systems for which they speak.  The major theoretical
patterns are organized under the following headings: (1) the classical
development, (2) the underconsumption analysis, (3) the institutionalists, and
(4) the contemporary complex.</p>

<p class=Body  >            The development following
the lead of W. S. Jevons’ innovation in value theory frequently is classified
separately from the classical doctrine proper.  This utility-based system of
analysis usually has been called neo-classicism.  In the present study, the
neo-classical analysis is included under the first heading, the classical
development.  The reasons for this inclusion will become apparent in the
context of the discussion.</p>

<p class=Body  >            The recent resurgence of
the underconsumption theory requires that it be given consideration.  This
theory enters directly and indirectly into much of contemporary analysis.  It
has served directly as the basis for some government fiscal policy which has,
in turn, had effects on the problem of government ownership.  And some of its
tenets enter importantly into analyses which cannot properly be classified as
underconsumptionist.  This is true especially of the general theory of the
level of employment which has gained wide credence since 1936 and which has
brought into fresh focus the whole problem of possible alternative control
organization of wide areas of economic enterprise.</p>

<p class=Body  >            [7] The
“institutionalists” are designated as a separate category in this study.  They
are given separate designation, not to identify a “complete” economic theory,
but rather to allow facile reference for concepts that are pertinent to the
present study.  There is, as yet, no detailed, and certainly no complete
pattern of analysis that may be said to be held in common by the theorists who
are usually referred to as institutionalists.  But this is not to say that
there is, in this instance, no real basis for separate designation.  Nor is it
to say that, since there is not here a “complete” general theory, application
to the problem at hand is inadvisable.  On the contrary, the basic theoretical
position of the founder of this “school” and the advancements that have been
developed from that position are particularly significant to the working-out of
the kind of economic problem under consideration in this study.</p>

<p class=Body  >            The contemporary complex
of economic theory is such that classification of particular theories under the
previous headings is not easy.  Some contemporary formulations are clearly
identifiable as specific continuations of a particular, inherited doctrine. 
But many of them evidence a mixed parentage.  And some contemporary
developments are so original in structure and content that they give strong
promise of initiating separately identified schools of economic thought.  Under
the heading “the contemporary complex” an effort is made to identify specific
continuations of the particular theoretical systems which already have been
classified, and these continuations are considered in relation to [8] the
problem of government ownership.  The unclassified developments are searched
for possibilities of the same application.</p>

<p class=Body  >            After economic theory is
explored in the order outlined above, the study proceeds to the examination of
a selected group of government-owned enterprises.  These are (1) streets and
highways, (2) harbors and waterways, (3) waterworks and sewage disposal, (4) schools,
(5) forestry, and (6) housing.  These enterprises are very diverse in terms of
the physical processes involved.  The choice on this score is deliberate.  In
any event, a representative sample of government owned enterprises would
necessarily include widely differing sorts of equipment and functions.  The
fact of diversity is therefore an important datum in itself.  The sample is
chosen so as to maintain fidelity with its universe in this regard.</p>

<p class=Body  >            It has been mentioned that
the reason for examining these government-owned enterprises is to try to find
pattern in the relevant data.  Patterns of some sort should be suggested by the
general theoretical systems and by the specific pronouncements on the problem
by the spokesmen for those systems.  The principles thus suggested should be
kept in mind while considering the specific cases of government-ownership.</p>

<p class=Body  >            It should be remembered
that the present study is a search for the general principles that are
applicable to all cases of government ownership.  An effort is made, therefore,
to find an organizational pattern that includes all of the facts brought out in
the study of actual cases of government ownership.  [9]  Beyond this, some
consideration is given to whatever indications the present study offers regarding
the character of general economic theory.</p>

<p class=Body align=center style='text-align:center'>THE CLASSICAL THEORY AND
GOVERNMENT OWNERSHIP</p>

<p class=Body  >&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body  >            It has been pointed out
that governments always have owned and operated some economic enterprises. 
This situation presented no general theoretical problem until the advent of a
general economic theory which seemed, at least on its face, to dictate the
general policy of <u>laissez faire</u>.  But after the advent of such a theory,
the acceptance of any government ownership presented something of a problem in
theory.  And the unanimous acceptance of the government ownership of some
economic enterprise presented a dilemma.</p>

<p class=Body  >            On the one hand, here were
what purported to be the basic general principles of economic theory.  Here
also was the inescapable pattern of the interworkings of those principles.  The
assertions of generality and of foundation involved the claim that the
principles were in some manner expressive of the inclusive and the continuing
factors which determine the on-going of the economic process.  And that pattern
of the interworkings of the general principles, that general theory, seemed to
spell out in unmistakable finality not only the propriety of <u>laissez faire</u>
but also the inescapable and actual driving effect of the basic economic forces
in that direction.  The classical system of analysis will be seen, at least in
its [11] earlier stages, to involve that pattern of theory.</p>

<p class=Body  >            On the other hand, here
were the palpable facts that government ownership did exist and had always
existed and that everyone, including the classical theorists, sanctioned the
government ownership of some economic enterprise.</p>

<p class=Body  >            These two sets of
circumstances presented the dilemma: how account for government ownership of
economic enterprise, either in terms of proper policy or in terms of actuality,
in view of a general theory which seemed to dictate the absolute contrary in
policy and the contrary tendency in fact?</p>

<p class=Body  >            This dilemma could be
disregarded.  But it conceivably could be resolved in only three ways: (1) the
position could be taken that government ownership of any economic enterprise
must be at the expense of the general efficiency of the economic process and
that, therefore, no economic enterprise should be government owned;<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[1]</span></span></span></a> 
(2) the theoretical formulation’s claim to generality and to foundation could
be abandoned and replaced with the restricted claim of applicability to
non-government-owned enterprise only;<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[2]</span></span></span></a> and (3) the general theory
itself could be modified in whatever  manner and degree necessary to include
the principles that determine government ownership.<a href="#_ftn3"
name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[3]</span></span></span></a> </p>

<p class=Body  >            [12] In the following
discussion, the part played by each of these three alternatives will be
considered in terms of its involvement in the relation between specific
analyses of government ownership and the major developments in the body of
general theory.</p>

<p class=Body  >&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body align=center style='text-align:center'>The Wealth of Nations</p>

<p class=Body  >&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body  >            The development of the
classical theory was the first widely recognized effort to make an inclusive
and a coherent analysis of the economic process, to “lay bare the principles
which underlie the working”<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[4]</span></span></span></a> of the economy.  It was thus
the first to give explicit recognition to the notion that social phenomena are
subject to scientific inquiry.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[5]</span></span></span></a>   In this line of development,
the first statement which could lay reasonable claim to presenting this
inclusive analysis was <u>An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth
of Nations</u> by Adam Smith.</p>

<p class=Body  >            Adam Smith’s analysis,
published in 1776, “was destined to be regarded as the <u>fons et origo</u> of
economic thought by many subsequent generations.”<a href="#_ftn6"
name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[6]</span></span></span></a> His
considerations furnished the [13] substance for and served as the immediate
parent of the main body of the classical analysis.  For this, Adam Smith has
been called the father of economics.  But this is not the sole evidence of his
fertility.  Many of his formulations have found ready use in heterodox theory,<a
href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[7]</span></span></span></a>
and in some instances he indicated the key to the disproof and consequent
abandonment of some items which he, at the same time, made integral parts of
the classical theory.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[8]</span></span></span></a>   Adam Smith’s contributions
have entered every school of economic thought.  His place in the development of
the science is preeminent.</p>

<p class=Body  >            The characteristics of
Smith’s treatment which have permitted its influence on so many different
systems of analysis are the very characteristics which cause difficulty in any
effort to outline the internal structure of its economic analysis.  It is
inconsistent in detail, and its inconsistencies frequently seem to arise from
shifts in the meanings of words.  Although some shifts are explicit and stated,
the reader frequently cannot determine just which referent Smith had in mind. 
But the general structure of the theory and the relation between [14] that
theory and the problem at hand are clear enough.</p>

<p class=Body  >            The outline which follows
does not have the organizational order used by Adam Smith.  It is arranged to
give the content and sequence that brings into sharpest focus the structure of
Smith’s theory as it may apply to the problem of the present study.  Only the
barest central content is used, and some aspects of his theory are not even
mentioned.  Smith made many digressions and used extensive corroborative
material that need not concern the present study.</p>

<p class=Body  >            <u>The Wealth of Nations</u>
is divided into five books:<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[9]</span></span></span></a>  (1) of the Causes of Improvement
in the productive Powers of Labour, and of the Order according to which its
Produce is naturally distributed among the different Ranks of the People; (2)
of the Nature, Accumulation, and Employment of Stock; (3) of the different
Progress of Opulence in different Nations; (4) of Systems of political Economy;
(5) of the Revenue of the Sovereign or Commonwealth.</p>

<p class=Body  >            In these five books, Smith
tried to throw light on what constitutes the general welfare and on how the
general welfare may be maximized.  He identified the general welfare with
“wealth” by which he meant the rate of real income, the annual <u>per-capita</u>
production, or “all the necessaries and conveniences [15] of life which it (the
nation) annually consumes.”<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[10]</span></span></span></a>   Explaining  how the annual <u>per-capita</u>
income is and may be maximized is the central content of the entire treatment.</p>

<p class=Body  >            Some students dissociate
Smith’s treatment of “what is” from his treatment of “what ought to be.”  But
Smith himself made no such dissociation.  He was considering the same central
problem throughout.  And that problem involved not only the principles
governing the material provision of the “necessaries and conveniences of life”
but also how to arrange policy so as to promote the most efficient operation of
that process.  For Smith, proper economic policy was a necessary disclosure of,
and part of, understanding the inclusive principles of the economic process.</p>

<p class=Body  >            The first two books of
Smith’s treatment are an explanation of his general theory.  The introductory
statement begins by identifying labor as</p>

<p class=Body  >&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body  >            ... the fund which
originally supplies it (the nation) with all the necessaries and</p>

<p class=Body  >            conveniences of life which
it annually consumes, and which consists always either</p>

<p class=Body  >            in the immediate produce
of that labour, or in what is purchased with that produce</p>

<p class=Body  >            from other nations.<a
href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[11]</span></span></span></a>
</p>

<p class=Body  >&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body  >            Then, since labor is the
original source of all wealth, the question becomes: what determines the
produce of labor, or, what determines the general efficiency of the use of the
[16] fund of labor?  To this question Smith answers:</p>

<p class=Body  >&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body  >            But this proportion (ratio
between population and aggregate consumers’</p>

<p class=Body  >            production) must in every
nation be regulated by two different circumstances; first,</p>

<p class=Body  >            by the skill, dexterity
and judgment with which its labour is generally applied; and,</p>

<p class=Body  >            secondly, by the
proportion between the number of those who are employed in</p>

<p class=Body  >            useful labor, and that of
those who are not so employed.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[12]</span></span></span></a> </p>

<p class=Body  >&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body  >            The total produce of any
nation obviously depends on the product of each unit of labor (the productive
factor) and the number of units of productive labor.  The next step, then, is
to find (1) the determinants of the efficiency of each unit of productively
employed labor and (2) the determinants of the number of such units.</p>

<p class=Body  >            The first factor, Smith
decided, depends on the degree of the division of labor<a href="#_ftn13"
name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[13]</span></span></span></a> 
which, in turn, springs from “the propensity to truck, barter, and exchange one
thing for another.”<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[14]</span></span></span></a>   But this increase in the
efficiency of labor, even though it “is in consequence of” the division of
labor, “is owing to” (1) increased skill because of the reduced number of
operations per worker, (2) the saving of time by concentrating on one
operation, and (3) “the invention of a great number of machines which
facilitate and abridge labour.”<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[15]</span></span></span></a>   The limiting [17] factors to
an increase in the division of labor (and therefore in efficiency) are (1) the
maintenance of an equal stock of provision, (2) the accumulation of a greater
stock of materials and tools,<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[16]</span></span></span></a> and (3) the size of the
market.  The latter depends on the perfection of transportation facilities and
the density of population.<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[17]</span></span></span></a> </p>

<p class=Body  >            The second factor, the
portion of the population engaged in productive employment, is found by Smith
to be determined by the amount of accumulated stock.  The quantity of accumulated
stock is not only a factor in determining the degree to which labor
specialization may be carried, it is also that which sets labor in motion.  It
constitutes the demand for labor.  It is that with which labor works, and its
quantity is therefore the major determinant of how large a portion of the
population may be engaged in productive employment.<a href="#_ftn18"
name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[18]</span></span></span></a>  
Smith considers labor non-productive if it is engaged in the direct
satisfaction of wants.  It is productive only if it is engaged in the creation
of that which enters the accumulated stock which, in turn, serves as the
support of labor and as tools which labor uses in further production.  Smith
observes that, in the current [18] state of affairs, since most non-productive
labor is purchased out of rent and profits, the ratio between the sum of rent
and profits and the expenditures for replacing capital will reflect the
proportion of the population engaged in non-productive employment.<a
href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[19]</span></span></span></a>
</p>

<p class=Body  >            Now, since the
accumulation of stock sets the limits to which labor may be specialized and
since it determines how great a proportion of the population is engaged in
productive employment, the next logical step is to find the determinants of the
accumulation of stock.</p>

<p class=Body  >            Smith finds that the
accumulation is founded in the self-love instinct and in that instinct’s
combination with foresight which results in parsimony or frugality.<a
href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[20]</span></span></span></a>
</p>

<p class=Body  >            Improved exercise of these
basic instincts is allowed through the “propensity to truck, barter, and
exchange one thing for another.”  For,</p>

<p class=Body  >&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body  >            As soon as stock has
accumulated in the hands of particular persons, some of</p>

<p class=Body  >            them will naturally employ
it in setting to work industrious people, whom they will</p>

<p class=Body  >            supply with materials and
subsistence, in order to make a profit by the sale of</p>

<p class=Body  >            their work, or by what
their labour adds to the value of the materials.<a href="#_ftn21"
name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[21]</span></span></span></a>  </p>

<p class=Body  >&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body  >            [19] The reason for
allowing the increased produce to become the property of any particular person
is that</p>

<p class=Body  >&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body  >            He could have no interest
to employ them, unless he expected from the sale of</p>

<p class=Body  >            their work, something more
than was sufficient to replace his stock to him; and </p>

<p class=Body  >            he could have no interest
to employ a great stock rather than a small one, unless</p>

<p class=Body  >            his profits were to bear
some proportion to the extent of his stock.<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22"
title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[22]</span></span></span></a> </p>

<p class=Body  >&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body  >Thus Smith finds that both private
property and profits are not only founded in human nature but also are
necessary to the accumulation of stock without which there could be no
improvement in the wealth of the community beyond the very lowest primitive
stages.</p>

<p class=Body  >            Then, since those who hold
accumulated stock could have no interest to employ a greater stock unless
thereby they be permitted to increase it, a necessary phase of the analysis is
to determine how that particular employment of stock is brought about.  Smith
finds that it is brought about through the operations of the market.  Since the
wealth of the nation depends upon the accumulation of stock and since the
accumulation of stock depends upon exchanging commodities, everything depends
in large measure upon the efficiency of the market process.  The market’s
driving force is the desire for gain, and its controlling factor is
competition.  Men offer their produce in the market in the hope of getting for
it something offering greater advantage to them than the retention of their own
produce.  [20] But the receivers of their goods are doing the same thing and so
no exchange is effected until both are satisfied, however reluctantly, on this
score.  The market not only offers exercise to the desire for gain, it also
brings commodities into common view.  The purchaser may choose to his best
advantage.  Then the only way an individual can increase his chances of gain is
to submit better items or to increase the efficiency of the production of those
items, and the only way he can increase his total receipts is to increase his
production.  Competition and the desire for gain force the maximum efficiency
in terms of quantity and quality of commodities.  Then anything that interferes
with the profit motive or with competition interferes with the efficiency of
the exchange process upon which the whole economic process depends.</p>

<p class=Body  >            Smith’s analyses of money
and price change none of this.<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[23]</span></span></span></a>   Money enters only because of
the difficulties of extensive, direct barter.  It serves only to account the real
operations which are greatly expanded because of its use.  Money serves merely
as the “great wheel of circulation.”<a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[24]</span></span></span></a> </p>

<p class=Body  >            Thus Smith can argue that
good management “can never be universally established but in consequence of
that free and universal competition which forces everybody to have [21]
recourse to it for the sake of self-defense.”<a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25"
title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[25]</span></span></span></a>   And
it is on grounds like these that he concludes, after applying his analysis to
the economic progress of different nations and systems:</p>

<p class=Body  >&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:35.0pt; text-indent:-35.0pt'>            It
is thus that every system which endeavours, either, by extraordinary
encouragements, to draw towards a particular species of industry a greater
share of the capital of the society than what would naturally go to it; or, by
extraordinary restraints, to force from a particular species of industry some
share of the capital which would otherwise be employed in it; is in reality
subversive of the great purpose which it means to promote.  It retards, instead
of accelerating, the progress of the society towards real wealth and greatness;
and diminishes, instead of increasing, the real value of the annual produce of
its land and labour.  </p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:35.0pt; text-indent:-35.0pt'>                        All
systems of preference or of restraint, therefore, being thus completely taken
away, the obvious and simple system of natural liberties establishes itself of
its own accord.</p>

performance of which no human wisdom or knowledge could ever be sufficient; the
duty of superintending the industry of private people, and of directing it
towards the employments more suitable to the interest of the society. 
According to the system of natural liberty, the sovereign has only three duties
to attend to; three duties of great importance, indeed, but plain and
intelligible to common understanding: first, the duty of protecting the society
from the violence and invasion of other independent societies; secondly, the
duty of protecting, as far as possible, every member of the society from the
injustice or oppression of every other member of it, or the duty of
establishing an exact administration of justice; and, thirdly, the duty of
erecting and maintaining certain publics works and certain public institutions,
which it can never be for the interest of any individual, or small number of

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>                        It
will be remembered that Adam Smith’s general theory involves the propositions:
(1) that the productive process depends on the accumulation of the physical
means of supporting labor and the accumulation of the physical equipment used
by productively employed labor, and (2) that this accumulation can be carried
forward only by exchange which is motivated by profit and regulated by
competition.  For, even though the individual seeks to employ his capital to
his own advantage, the forces of the market necessarily lead him “to prefer
that employment which is most advantageous to the society.”<a href="#_ftn28"

statesman, who should attempt to direct private people in what manner they
ought to employ their capitals, would not only load himself with a most
unnecessary attention, but assume an authority which could safely be trusted,
not only to no single person, but to no council or senate whatever, and which
would nowhere be so dangerous as in the hands of a man who [23] had folly and
presumption enough to fancy himself fit to exercise it.<a href="#_ftn29"

single person (government agent), but to no council or senate whatever.”</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>                        In
view of this theoretical position, it would seem, off hand, that no allowance
could be made for the government ownership of any economic enterprise.  But
Smith explicitly makes such an allowance on the basis that some enterprises
“may frequently do much more than repay” their expense to the economy but can
“never repay the expense to any individual or small number of individuals.” 
Here, there are economic enterprises which are determined, and Smith thought
properly so, by some other devices than the free market process.  Here, there
are allocations of capital, stocks of provisions and equipment, which are motivated,
and properly so, by some other tenet than that the returns from sales “be
sufficient to replace (the) stock.”<a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span

enterprises which violate every determinant of how all economic enterprise
comes into existence.  It would seem that such enterprises not only should not
exist, but also that they could not exist.  It is certain, on the basis [24] of
Smith’s general theory, that stocks so used could not return “much more” to the
economy’s accumulated stock than they withdraw from it.  Clearly, Smith was
involved in the dilemma indicated at the beginning </p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>                        The
government-owned enterprises which are of interest in the present study are, in

must increase with the general economic development of the society.  He
proceeded by pointing out that such enterprises can be supported by charges
levied against those who directly receive the service or commodity and that
thereby no burden is necessarily imposed on [25] the general revenue.  He
pointed out also that some such enterprises (e.g., coinage and post-offices)
can thus gain a return sufficient for defraying their own expense and thus
satisfy his principle that they return to the society more than their own
expense.  In the matter of charges for service, Smith was willing to deviate
from the cost-of-service principle in order to have</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>                        Smith
was concerned primarily with tax policy and administrative policy in relation
to public enterprise.  He pointed out that many governmental agencies have
their origin in commercial enterprise, and he urged that they be carried on by
the executive rather than granted to companies of merchants.  He held this view
even in those cases in which the agency is for the protection of a particular
branch of trade because “the protection of any particular branch of trade is a
part of the general protection of trade.”<a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37"
title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[37]</span></span></span></a>   But
he did not follow this through to the other aspects of particular trades which
require a larger capital than can be provided by private partnership and where
the risk, or whatever, is such that no expectancy of profit could be held
without monopoly privilege.  For these, [26] Smith was prepared to grant </p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>a
temporary monopoly “to recompense them for hazarding a dangerous and expensive
experiment,of which the public is afterwards to reap the benefit.”<a

class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[38]</span></span></span></a>  
In this instance, Smith seems to have abandoned his principle of government
ownership.  But even here, the abandonment is not in terms that follow from his
general theory.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>                        Smith
realized that the joint-stock-company technique of organizing an enterprise
does some violence to his general theory.  He concluded however that such
organization, without a granted monopoly, can work out in only four
enterprises: banking, insurance, canals, and waterworks.  The reason it can
work out in those four instances is that the processes in each of them can be
“reduced to strict rules.”<a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[39]</span></span></span></a>   Smith did not work out the
possible connection between the principles underlying what he considered the
proper joint-stock-company enterprises and his principles of government
ownership although he did discuss them in the same chapter.  The two are
grouped together in recognition that both are non-private in the sense upon
which his general theory is founded.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>                        Smith
considered education from the same standpoint that he considered aids to
commerce.  He concluded that the closer education is kept to the competitive
level, the more efficient it becomes.  However, he thought that it could not be
left to [27] private enterprise because the forces of the market would result
in people entering productive employment at such an early age that they could
not render their full possible complement to the economy.<a href="#_ftn40"
name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[40]</span></span></span></a>   On
this point, it is not only the early age of employment and consequent lack of
schooling that is concerned, there is also the deadening effect of the
specialization of modern labor which precludes the diversity of activity that
Smith considered the key to the high intellectual attainment of previous
cultures.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>                        In
all of this there is no clue to how it was that Smith reconciled his principle
of government ownership with his general theory.  In none of his statements on
particular government-owned enterprises is it even mentioned that there is
disrapport between the two.  He pursued none of the three possible
alternatives.  The present writer is persuaded that Smith was unaware of any such
problem.</p>

the appearance of <u>The Wealth of Nations</u>, there occurred three
theoretical developments which were to furnish [28] some of the distinguishing
characteristics of the next general formulation of economic theory.  Thomas
Robert Malthus first published his theory of population in 1798.   Its central
thesis was that population naturally and inevitably increased more rapidly than
the means of subsistence.  He elaborated the thesis and modified it somewhat in
a book on the subject published in 1803.<a href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41"
title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[41]</span></span></span></a>   In
the latter publication he withdrew the inevitability aspect, but the central
thesis that population tends always to press on the means of subsistence
remained to be incorporated in an important way into the classical doctrine. 
The other of the two developments was the theory of diminishing returns in agriculture. 
The idea that additional quantities of capital and labor applied to a given
land area will yield smaller returns than the previous application is implicit
in the differential rent theory presented by Adam Smith<a href="#_ftn42"
name="_ftnref42" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[42]</span></span></span></a>  in
1776 and specifically stated the next year by James Anderson.<a href="#_ftn43"
name="_ftnref43" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[43]</span></span></span></a>   It
was presented as a universal law by Edward West in 1815,<a href="#_ftn44"
name="_ftnref44" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[44]</span></span></span></a>  but
it remained for David Ricardo to extend the principle and to [29] incorporate
it into the body of general theory.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>                        A
third development between Adam Smith and Ricardo that entered importantly into
the latter’s formulation was the dictum that supply creates its own demand and
that the aggregate supply and demand therefore are always equal.  This is
attributed by Ricardo to Jean-Baptiste Say.<a href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45"
title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[45]</span></span></span></a>   But
even without outside contribution it would necessarily evolve out of Ricardo’s
organization of his own theory.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>                        These
elements, together with a consistent and unified theory of valuation were used
by David Ricardo to make a narrower and somewhat new formulation of the general
principles.  Ricardo himself did not consider directly the problem of
government ownership.  He therefore was not directly confronted with the
problem which is the principle concern of this study.  The organization of his
theory is treated here very summarily only to indicate the basic theory from
which later theorists worked in the classical line of development.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>                        Many
students have emphasized that Ricardo thought economics properly should be
concerned with the laws determining the distribution of the aggregate income
among the “three classes of the community,” land owners, capitalists, and
laborers.  He says in the preface to his <u>Principles</u> that “To determine
the laws which regulate this distribution is the principal problem [30] in
Political Economy,” and in a letter to Malthus he goes so far as to say that
economics should be called “an inquiry into the laws which determine the
divisions of the produce of industry amongst the classes who concur in its
formation.”<a href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[46]</span></span></span></a>   However, this is not necessarily
to say that Ricardo claimed the purpose of the economic process was to divide
income so as to maximize the benefits for any particular class.  Whatever may
have been his predilections on this score, he still considered that “to procure
these gratifications (‘the conveniences and ornaments of life’) in the greatest
abundance is the object in view.”<a href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[47]</span></span></span></a>   His concern was with finding
the dynamics of the “simple and obvious system of natural liberties” which he
assumed to be the entire economy.  For, since the “produce of the earth--all
that is derived from its surface” is divided among the three classes
differently in the “different stages of society,” if the determinants of that
division could be correctly perceived, the dynamics of economic development
would stand in view.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>                        Ricardo
began with the theory of value which he considered simply and always “embodied”
labor.  He refuses to follow Smith’s abandonment of the quantity-of-labor
theory in accounting for non-labor incomes.  His position is, in effect, [31]
that Smith’s labor-command theory is properly mere extension of the labor-cost
theory into more advanced stages of the economy.  For example, in referring to
Smith’s famous beaver-and-deer example, Ricardo pointed out that the labor
required to provide the hunting instruments would necessarily enter into the
determination of the exchange-value of the game.<a href="#_ftn48"

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>                        And
it is here that his validification of returns to capital is founded in labor

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>                        All

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>Capital
then is expended, like anything else, in exchange for equal quantities of
embodied labor.  But this does not solve the problem of surplus value, or
profit.  If equal labor incorporated into capital equipment exchanged for equal
labor in the items secured to replace it, how could capital equipment ever be
increased?<a href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[50]</span></span></span></a>   Subsequently, attempts have
been made to resolve this dilemma by allowing the value of labor to vary (as
Ricardo himself allowed it to vary) over time and between countries and thus to
permit the present exchange-value of labor incorporated in capital equipment
produced in the past or in [32] another country to exceed the exchange value of
labor currently incorporated in its replacement.<a href="#_ftn51"
name="_ftnref51" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[51]</span></span></span></a>   This
would work out through the differences in the degree of durability of capital
assets which introduce deviations from the labor-cost determination of
exchange-value.  But, even here, the deviation would be occasioned by the
necessity to include profits on the more durable asset over a longer period. 
This would return the problem to where it started.<a href="#_ftn52"
name="_ftnref52" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[52]</span></span></span></a>   But
Ricardo’s primary concern was with what determines the <u>proportionate</u>
incomes of the economic classes, and so by assuming profits he managed to
disregard the violence done to his labor-cost theory of wages by the implied
explanation of surplus value.  Thus, for his purposes, assumption was more
acceptable than explanation.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>                        Wages,
in the Ricardian analysis, are determined by the labor-cost of the maintenance
and replacement of labor, the quantity of labor required to provide the
sustenance of labor.  Wages, therefore, depend on the marginal productivity of
labor in agriculture.  Therefore, since real wages <u>per capita</u> remain
constant because of the Manthusian law of population, the portion of the total
“produce of the earth” that goes for wages depends on how far the margin is
extended in agriculture.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>                        Ricardo
defined rent as “that portion of the produce of the earth which is paid to the
landlord for the use of the [33] original and indestructible powers of the
soil.”<a href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[53]</span></span></span></a>  
It, as such, has no labor cost and is therefore not determinable in the open
market process, and it cannot enter into price.  It is determined by the
differential in the natural productivity of different tracts of land.  As more
and more land is brought into cultivation, the difference in fertility, and
other advantages, of different tracts of land increases.  The portion of
aggregate income that goes to landlords is determined by the degree of
extension of the margin in agriculture.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>                        All
economic classes, according to Ricardo, receive incomes which, as portions of
the aggregate income, are determined by the extension of the margin in
agriculture.  The portion received by laborers and that received by landlords
increase as the margin is extended; the portion received by capitalists
decreases on the same count.  But neither profits nor wages contribute anything
to rents<a href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[54]</span></span></span></a>
by virtue of an extension of the margin.  It is rather that the “stage of
society” is thereby determined.  And by the “stage of society” Ricardo seems to
mean the proportion of capital to the total of all the productive factors.  He
concludes that society will gradually approach a static state because, at
bottom, there is no way to prevent an extension of the margin in agriculture. 
[34] Capital accumulation will stop because the increase in the labor cost of
food will raise the cost of labor and thus reduce profits below what is
necessary to motivate investment; labor, having human procreational tendencies,
will press the agricultural margin to the limits set by land area and
techniques of cultivation; rent will increase and landlords will receive the
income allowed by the extremest difference in the “original and indestructible”
productive powers of different soils.  Economics became known as the “dismal
science.”</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>                        The
Ricardian theory is an analysis of how the income of an economy is distributed
among the economic classes by the open-market process operating under
conditions of full and free competition.  It may not properly be said to arrive
at the <u>laissez-faire</u> position.  Rather, it assumes that position.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>                        Ricardo

founded the classical theory in what he considered the inclusive and continuing
factors, the basic factors, of the economic process.  He brought the analysis
forward to the market process.  Ricardo started with the market process as his

conclusion of that process.  He started with the market [35] process and he
ended with the market process.<a href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55" title=""><span

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>                        The
classical theory at this stage of development proved to be vulnerable to
criticism.  The difficulty involved in founding profits and rents on the labor
theory of value was apparent.  And it was for this reason that both those who
favored the policy indications of the theory and those who opposed them focused
their attention on this point.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>                        The
utility theory of value had been given considerable attention by continental
theorists, especially by J. B. Say, who, like Ricardo, found his point of

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>                        Senior
is of particular interest in relation to the present study because of his close
personal familiarity with the problem of policy in government enterprise and
because of his influence on the trend of development of the classical theory. 
His membership in the faculties of the University of Oxford and his service in
various government agencies prompted his extended consideration of possible
foundations in economic theory for policy in government enterprise.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>                        [36]Senior
began his outline of economic theory by defining economics as “the Science
which treats of the Nature, the Production, and the Distribution of Wealth.” 
He immediately proceeded to define wealth as</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>                        ...

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>Already,
it is clear that Senior must explain the nature and the production of wealth as
well as the distribution of wealth in terms of the market process.  For,
although <u>wealth</u> equals <u>value</u> which will be explained to have
foundations in realities beyond and antecedent to <u>exchange</u>, it is “an
equivalent expression” to “susceptibility of exchange” which, in turn, is
determinable in the process of trading one thing for another - that is to say,
the market process.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>                        Senior’s
analysis avoids the difficulties resulting from the Ricardian labor theory of
value by placing both labor and capital in the common category, real costs. 
The exertion of labor and the abstinence involved in investing are common in
terms of some sort of disutility.  The real costs are [37] psychological.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>                        Senior
holds that these real costs determine supply in the sense that they are the
obstacles which must be overcome in order to bring about production.  But
demand, too, is psychological. It is the degree “in which its possession is
desired.”<a href="#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[58]</span></span></span></a>  
It “denotes no intrinsic quality in the things which we call useful; it merely
expresses their relations to the pains and pleasures of mankind.”<a

class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[59]</span></span></span></a>  
And, since those relations are reciprocal, the demand for “an object of
purchase or hire is principally dependent on the obstacles which limit its
supply.”<a href="#_ftn60" name="_ftnref60" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[60]</span></span></span></a>  
The balance of forces toward which free exchange directs production is that
between a progressively increasing psychological cost and a progressively
decreasing utility.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>                        This
view of real costs offers no explanation of rent beyond payment for “having
permitted the gifts of nature to be accepted.”<a href="#_ftn61" name="_ftnref61"
title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[61]</span></span></span></a>   But
it purports to offer the continuing and inclusive principles which explain the
economic process in terms of the real costs of the productive factors.  That
is, it purports to explain “the Nature, the Production, and the Distribution
[38] of Wealth.”<a href="#_ftn62" name="_ftnref62" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[62]</span></span></span></a>   The prospect of pleasure or
avoidance of pain, (utility) causes men to overcome the obstacles to production
(exertion of labor and abstinence).  The stage of perfection to which this
process is carried depends upon the degree of freedom of the interplay of that
pattern of motivation.  The interplay of that pattern of motivation is the
market process.  Therefore, the measure of perfection of the economic process
is the degree of freedom in the market.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>                        Senior
personally was never able to convince himself that <u>laissez faire</u> was the
proper position.  Although he understood quite well that government enterprise
“is not conducted on the principles which regulate ordinary exchanges,”<a

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>Observations
of this kind evidently led Senior to some appreciation of their disrapport with
the implications of his general theory.  For his later writings evince a
strenuous and extended effort to discern correctly the relation between
economics and those enterprises which produce and distribute things “which [39]
are transferable, are limited in supply, and are directly or indirectly
productive of pleasure or preventive of pain,” but which, nevertheless, are
“not conducted on principles which regulate ordinary exchanges.”<a

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>                        After
considering the military and police service and the postal service as examples
of how the coordinated attention and efforts of a few persons accomplishes
results which are far beyond what could be accomplished by many more people
acting independently, Senior states that “The utility of government depends on
this principle.”<a href="#_ftn66" name="_ftnref66" title=""><span

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>                        But
this is the very principle upon which the economic efficacy, or the utility, of
the open market depends.  Senior explains that capital is accumulated most
efficiently through the free market process because that process gives free
play to the motives for accumulating productive instruments and organizing
labor in the most efficient manner.  As an example of the results of this
accumulation and organization he cites the cotton industry:</p>

directed to the manufacture of cotton goods, could, in a whole generation,</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>This
principle might be used to estimate the utility of any or all enterprise.  But
it cannot serve to designate government ownership as distinct from private
ownership unless it is better served by one form of ownership than the other. 
In regard to the postal service, Senior seems to have in mind the idea that
here there are principles involved that allow the government ownership of the
enterprise to accomplish the higher efficiency.  But he does not specify what
those principles are.</p>

that those who require the protection of education most are those who cannot or
will not pay for it, for “it is only the educated who are aware that education
is necessary.”<a href="#_ftn72" name="_ftnref72" title=""><span

font-family:Arial'>[72]</span></span></span></a>   When Senior was working with
the Committee of the House of Commons on the Poor Law Relief of England, he was
”astonished” and “grieved” because of an implied denial by a conferee that the
state must assume “all the responsibilities (to a child) from which absolute
inability discharges the parent.”<a href="#_ftn73" name="_ftnref73" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[73]</span></span></span></a>   However, that implied denial
could well have rested on the proposition that the unobstructed market process
most efficiently works out the maximum efficiency of those things having to do
with wealth, and that since education is a “great promoter of Wealth,” it
properly should be left to the market process.  And the conferee could have stated
Senior’s <u>Political Economy</u> as proof of that position.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>                        Senior’s
latter essay indicates that individual inability to pay for a necessary item is
basis for the government provision of that item.  His position at this point
may be set in contrast to his general position stated in connection with his
[42] treatment of general theory where he says:</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:37.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>            The
essential business of government is to afford defense; to protect the community
against foreign and domestic violence and fraud.  Unfortunately, however, governments
have generally supposed it to be their duty, not merely to give <u>security</u>,
but <u>wealth</u>; not merely to enable their subjects to produce and enjoy in
safety, but to teach them <u>what</u> to produce and <u>how</u> to enjoy; to
give them instruction how to manage their own concerns, and to force them to
obey that instruction.</p>

that essay it is stated that the government’s effort to protect individuals
from the evils of poverty (as one of the ways of trying to make men happy) is
not only likely to fail but is “liable to produce results precisely the reverse
of those intended by the legislator ...”  But in the same essay, after
considering housing and factory legislation Senior concluded that</p>

of the community.  It is the duty of a government to do whatever is conducive
to the welfare of the governed.  The only limit to this duty is its power.  And
as the supreme government of an independent state is necessarily absolute, the
only limit to its power is physical or moral inability.  And whatever it is its

this rule seems to allow any degree or kind of adjustment in the institutions

principle, like that of efficiency, cannot serve as a principle by which
government enterprise can be distinguished, as such, either in terms of proper
arrangement or in terms of historical fact.  Either or both principles may be
used as the standard of judgment by which either or both of the alternative
patterns of ownership may be judged.  But in that case the principles would be
those which determine that any given enterprise is more efficiently [44] carried
on, or is more contributory to the general welfare, under one pattern of
ownership than under the other.  To this question, Senior’s general theory
gives only the answer private ownership, and his special considerations of the
problem offer no alternative principles.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>                        Five
years before the appearance of Senior’s <u>Political Economy</u>, John Stuart
Mill published five essays which were later combined into a book entitled <u>Essays
on Some Unsettled Questions of Political Economy</u>.<a href="#_ftn78"

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[78]</span></span></span></a><span
class=FootnoteIndex>  </span>In the last of these essays he stated that
economics itself cannot be a collection of practical rules but that “unless it
be altogether a useless science, practical rules must be capable of being
founded upon it.”<a href="#_ftn79" name="_ftnref79" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[79]</span></span></span></a>   Mill’s later work in
economics maintained this idea of the functional importance of economic
theory.  His <u>Principles</u>, which appeared seventeen years later, included
in the title, and in the treatment proper, “Some of Their Applications to
Social Philosophy.”  His purpose was to incorporate into the general theory all
the developments which had occurred since Adam Smith and to apply the refined
theory to the major problems of society.  The [45] general theory had been
refined and society had changed, and so the time was proper for a new treatment
based on the Smithian conception of the necessary relation between economic
theory and economic policy.<a href="#_ftn80" name="_ftnref80" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[80]</span></span></span></a> </p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>                        Mill
identified the same triad of productive agents that his predecessors had used. 
Although he retained the distinction between productive and non-productive
labor, he agreed with Say that labor “is not creative of objects, but of
utilities.”<a href="#_ftn81" name="_ftnref81" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[81]</span></span></span></a>   The identification of
productive labor is then placed on the susceptibility of accumulation of the
utilities which the labor produces.  But then the productive category is
obscured by including labor “which yields no material product as its direct
result, provided that an increase of material products is its ultimate
consequence.”<a href="#_ftn82" name="_ftnref82" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[82]</span></span></span></a>   It is the accumulation
aspect that counts and it is this aspect which determines wealth.  Wealth is
“any product which is both useful and susceptible of accumulation.”<a
href="#_ftn83" name="_ftnref83" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[83]</span></span></span></a>  
Capital is “a stock, previously accumulated, of the products of former labor.”<a
href="#_ftn84" name="_ftnref84" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[84]</span></span></span></a>  
[46] But this is not sufficient identification because:</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.5in; text-indent:-3.0pt'> The
distinction, then, between Capital and Not-capital, does not lie in the kind of
commodity, but in the mind of the capitalist - in his will to employ them for
one purpose rather than another; and all property, however ill adapted in
itself for the use of labourers, is a part of capital, so soon as it, or the
value to be received from it, is set apart for productive reinvestment.<a
href="#_ftn85" name="_ftnref85" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span

<p class=Body style='margin-left:3.0pt; text-indent:-3.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:3.0pt; text-indent:-3.0pt'> Labor
is productive if it produces something that is not directly consumed.  What is
not directly (or forthwith) consumed is that which the capitalist decides to
invest.  Therefore it must follow that productive labor is that which produces
capital.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:3.0pt; text-indent:-3.0pt'>            Mill
thus presents production as being carried on within the limits set by physical
facts but nevertheless as being controlled essentially by those persons who
decide whether a commodity is to be consumed or invested.  Thus, although he
opens his discussion of distribution by stating that “The laws and conditions
of the production of wealth partake of the character of physical truths” and
are not subject to arbitrary decision whereas distribution can be arranged at
will,<a href="#_ftn86" name="_ftnref86" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[86]</span></span></span></a> 
he already has prescribed the key to the distribution pattern.  Since the
deciding function of the capitalist depends upon the institutional pattern and
since that function is central to the whole of the productive process, it must
necessarily follow that the theory of distribution will have to mould itself in
[47] conformity with that same institutional pattern.  And so it does.,</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:3.0pt; text-indent:-3.0pt'>            Mill
pointed out that competition is not the only controlling influence in the
market process.  Custom also enters.<a href="#_ftn87" name="_ftnref87" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[87]</span></span></span></a>   But “only through the
principle of competition has political economy any pretension to the character
of a science.”<a href="#_ftn88" name="_ftnref88" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[88]</span></span></span></a>   “Wages, then, depend mainly
upon the demand and supply of labour; or, as it is often expressed, on the
proportion between population and capital.”<a href="#_ftn89" name="_ftnref89"
title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[89]</span></span></span></a>  
Profits depend on the cost of labor and the productivity of labor, on “the
ratio which the remuneration of the labourers bears to the amount they
produce.”<a href="#_ftn90" name="_ftnref90" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[90]</span></span></span></a>  
Rent is determined by the “difference between the unequal returns to different
parts of the capital employed on the soil” which in turn depends on the
intensive and extensive margin in agriculture.  It must be paid, like profits
and wages, in order to have use of the productive factor for which it is
payment.<a href="#_ftn91" name="_ftnref91" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[91]</span></span></span></a>  
</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:3.0pt; text-indent:-3.0pt'>            This
distribution is carried out through the market process.  Because of the forces
of competition, the exchange value, equalizing supply and demand, drive both
supply and demand [48] into equilibrium at the cost of the marginal unit which
is composed of labor and capital only.<a href="#_ftn92" name="_ftnref92"
title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[92]</span></span></span></a>  
Competition is the controlling factor, and it can operate most effectively in
the open market.  Mill does not presume to add anything to the theory of value
or exchange-value.  On that matter he states:</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:3.0pt; text-indent:-3.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:3.0pt; text-indent:-3.0pt'>            Happily,
these is nothing in the laws of value which remains (1848) for the present</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:3.0pt; text-indent:-3.0pt'>            or
any future writer to clear up; the theory of the subject is complete.<a

<p class=Body style='margin-left:3.0pt; text-indent:-3.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:3.0pt; text-indent:-3.0pt'>            Mill’s
general theoretical treatment arrives at the same position as that of his
classical predecessors, and his procedures are the same.  But his treatment
extends much further than either Ricardo’s or Senior’s.  It includes inquiries
into possible applications which he treats along with the general theory and in
which he introduces so many deviations from the structure of his general theory
that it is difficult to see the intended connections.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:3.0pt; text-indent:-3.0pt'>            The
fifth book of Mill’s <u>Principles of Political Economy</u> is devoted to the
influence of government.  It begins by designating two sets of categories for
government functions: (1) necessary and optional, and (2) authoritative and
unauthoritative.  Under “necessary” are included all those functions which are
universally and unanimously recognized as proper to government; under “optional”
are included “those respecting [49] which it has been considered questionable
whether governments should exercise them or not.”<a href="#_ftn94"
name="_ftnref94" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[94]</span></span></span></a>   The
functions involving mandamus or injunction are included in the “authoritative”
category; those not involving mandamus or injunction are included in the
“unauthoritative” category.  The last-named kind of intervention is indicated:</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:3.0pt; text-indent:-3.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:37.0pt; text-indent:-3.0pt'>...
when a government, instead of issuing a command and reinforcing it by
penalties, adopts the course so seldom resorted to by governments, and of which
such important use might be made, that of giving advice, and promulgating
information; or when, leaving individuals free to use their own means of
pursuing any object of general interest, the government, not meddling with
them, but not trusting the object solely to their care, establishes, side by
side with their arrangements, an agency of its own for  a like purpose.<a

<p class=Body style='margin-left:37.0pt; text-indent:-3.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:3.0pt; text-indent:-3.0pt'> Mill
stated five objections which may be offered to this sort of government
function:<a href="#_ftn96" name="_ftnref96" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[96]</span></span></span></a> 
(1) the increase in taxation or, if otherwise financed, the expenditures; (2)
the danger of increasing the government’s power and influence; (3) the increase
in complexity of government resulting in greater inefficiency; (4) the lack of
responsible interest as compared to private owner; (5) the loss of the
educational effects of “labour, contrivance, (and) self control” which the
difficulties of private enterprise stimulates.  These five objections are given
as the principal reasons for the general position of <u>laissez-faire</u>. 
[50] “Every departure from it unless required by some great good, is a certain
evil.”<a href="#_ftn97" name="_ftnref97" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[97]</span></span></span></a>
</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:3.0pt; text-indent:-3.0pt'>            Each
of these reasons for objecting to government enterprise can be related to the
general theory expounded by Mill.  (1) The general theory classifies government
functionaries as unproductive labor.  Then it follows that an increase in
government receipts, whether by taxation or otherwise would be a diminution of
the stock comprising the demand for productive labor.  (2) Increasing the
government’s power and influence offers some danger to that “originality of
mind and individuality of character which are the only source of any real
progress.”  They are crucial in the economic process because they serve toward
progress through the decisions to invest which are the controlling factor in determining
the character and rate of progress.  (3) The increase in complexity requires an
accountancy system that could be replaced by the costless forces of the market,
and it loses the advantage of isolated attention which is one form of the
division of labor.  (4) The general theory of markets involves the idea that
the highest interest and application results from the responsibility of
ownership because it involves the possibility of greater disutility in case of
failure.  (5) The educational effects of labor, contrivance, and self-control
are greatest in the market-determined process [51] because it is there that the
greatest rewards are given for their development and the greatest penalties are
imposed because of their lack.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:3.0pt; text-indent:-3.0pt'>            Mill
found, however, that there are instances in which these objections are absent
or are overruled by counter-considerations of still greater importance.<a
href="#_ftn98" name="_ftnref98" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[98]</span></span></span></a> 
</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:3.0pt; text-indent:-3.0pt'>            First,
there are some things which are of unmistakable utility but of which “the
demand of the market is by no means a test.”  Education, asyla for insane
persons, and the protection of lower animals are offered as examples.  The
reasons the demand schedules in the open market cannot reflect the real values
in such instances are : (1) the consumer cannot be qualified to judge the
utility of the commodity; (2) the consumer cannot pay the cost; or (3) the
consumer has no discretion in the matter because he is under the autocratic
power of another person.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:3.0pt; text-indent:-3.0pt'>            Second,
there are instances in which no amount of discretion and wisdom is sufficient. 
Contracts in perpetuity are cited as an example.  Whenever the period of an
agreement exceeds the possible foresight of parties thereto, there is economic
ground for voidance.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:3.0pt; text-indent:-3.0pt'>            Third,
some enterprises, if left to spontaneous agency, can be carried on only by an
arrangement which divorces control and ownership.  This results in the
infringement of those forces [52] in the free market, on the supply side, which
drive the supply and demand equilibrium into the optimum position.  Joint stock
companies are the example given here.  Wherever ownership is driven to a degree
of remove from control which exceeds the influence over government policy
exercised by the citizen, then the enterprise is better carried on by the
government.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:3.0pt; text-indent:-3.0pt'>            Fourth,
enterprises in which monopoly cannot be avoided require that the government
either operate them directly or so control them that the “profits of the
monopoly may at least be obtained for the public.”  In these enterprises,</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:3.0pt; text-indent:-3.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.5in; text-indent:-.5in'>            There
are the expenses without the advantages of plurality of agency; and the charge
made for services which cannot be dispensed with, is, in substance, quite as
much compulsory taxation as if imposed by law; there are few householders who
make any distinction between their “water-rate” and their other local taxes.<a
href="#_ftn99" name="_ftnref99" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.5in; text-indent:-.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:3.0pt; text-indent:-3.0pt'>            Fifth,
there are cases in which the interests of individuals cannot be brought into
play except through concerted action which cannot be effective unless “it
receives validity and sanction from the law.”  The point in view here is that
the state should provide assurance of collective action in case the immediate
and future interests of the individual can be made to correspond with the
interests of society only if everyone else will act in the same manner and if,
at the same time, the interests of the individual under separate choice
dictates a different course.  The examples offered in this instance are [53]
labor legislation reducing the hours of labor and the Wakefield colonization
policy in which land could not be appropriated beyond the quantity which the
individual can cultivate.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:3.0pt; text-indent:-3.0pt'>            Sixth,
instances in which the purchaser is not the consumer may require that the
government function as the purchaser.  The example discussed in this connection
is public relief in which the upper limit of public relief is set at less than
the lowest market wage in order to regain the compulsions of the labor market. 
Another example that generally falls in this subsidy category is colonization. 
The basic reason that colonization requires subsidy is the difficulty of
enforcing labor contracts where unoccupied land is freely available.  The
probability of the laborer absconding to free land makes the return on
transporting him to and establishing him in a new land very doubtful.  But the
economic benefits of transferring people from congested countries to areas
where the other productive agents are abundant may be very great.  Still other
examples of activities requiring subsidy are scientific research and the
“cultivation of speculative knowledge.”  The reason that these activities
cannot be brought to fruition in the market is that their benefit is received
by society at large and falls so insensibly on individuals that they are not
activated in the ordinary market sense.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:3.0pt; text-indent:-3.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:38.0pt; text-indent:-38.0pt'>             It
may be said generally, that anything which is desirable should be done for the
general interests of mankind or of future generations, or for the present
interests of those members of the community who require external aid, but which
is not of a nature [54] to remunerate individuals or associations for
undertaking it, is in itself a suitable thing to be undertaken by government:
though, before making the work their own, governments ought always to consider
if there be any rational probability of its being done on what is called the
voluntary principle, and if so, whether it is likely to be done in a better or
more effectual manner by government agency, than by the zeal and liberality of
individuals.<a href="#_ftn100" name="_ftnref100" title=""><span

Mill considered as exceptions to the general laws of the market.  But he was

all clear that Mill considered the laws of the market real laws.  In the
introduction to his exposition of the theory of distribution, he states:</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:5.0pt; text-indent:-5.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:33.0pt; '>Whatever mankind

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>The

class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[103]</span></span></span></a>   But his expressed view of
distribution is quite the contrary.  He held that distribution “depends on the
laws and customs of society.”  It “is a matter [55] of human institutions
solely.”<a href="#_ftn104" name="_ftnref104" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[104]</span></span></span></a>   Evidently, Mill would not
claim generality for the laws of the market.  Evidently, there were other laws
having to do with part of the economic process.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>                        But
it has already been pointed out that Mill’s unalterable laws of production
involve the distinction between “capital and not-capital” as being in the “mind
of the capitalist” because it is there that the productive or non-productive
use of a commodity is decided.  And the capitalist’s decision rests on his
estimation of the probability of whether the greater gain will accrue to him by
consuming the stock directly or allocating it to support others in return for
their further production.  This basic characteristic of human nature is, then,
fundamental to production.  But this is the very same fundamental human trait
which finds expression in the market process and which forces, through
competition, the optimum arrangement of the productive factors except in so are
as it is interfered with.  Evidently, Mill did not realize that his theory of
production prescribed the pattern of his theory of distribution and that to
abandon the claim of generality in the latter necessarily involves the
abandonment of the same claim in the former.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:5.0pt; text-indent:-5.0pt'>            It
cannot be claimed, then, that Mill’s principles of government ownership are
founded in either his theory of distribution or his theory of production.  The
connections [56] between each of his reasons for <u>laissez-faire</u> and his
general theory have been pointed out, and his general theory is seen to serve
as foundation for those reasons.  But his principles of government ownership
must stand on other grounds.  And Mill himself has said that unless economics
“be altogether a useless science, practical rules must be capable of being
founded on it.”<a href="#_ftn105" name="_ftnref105" title=""><span

<p class=Body style='margin-left:5.0pt; text-indent:-5.0pt'>            After
1821, the theory of value was shifted more and more from its foundation on
labor measured in time units toward a new foundation which could have no units
of measurement outside the market process.  The Ricardian theory had been able
to proceed from its real value determinant to the market process by assuming
that the unrestricted market placed the various kinds of labor in the same
array-distribution in price terms that they would display in labor-content
terms.  This imputation permitted Ricardo’s distribution theory to claim some
foundations in an obvious fact.  But it also furnished critics with a referent
which could be measured, or at least comprehended, in non-price terms and which
could therefore serve as a basis for checking the results of his analysis. 
Utility, as the non-price referent for value, avoids this difficulty.</p>

<p class=Body  >                        [57] Utility
had been a part of the Ricardian theory only in so far as it was a necessary
property of valuable items.  It was not the sufficient, determining factor.  In
1871, Stanley Jevons began his presentation of general economic theory with the
statement that “value depends entirely upon utility.”<a href="#_ftn106"
name="_ftnref106" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[106]</span></span></span></a>   He
then defined value as “ratio of exchange.”<a href="#_ftn107" name="_ftnref107"
title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[107]</span></span></span></a>   In
defining utility he agreed with Senior that “Utility denotes no intrinsic
quality in the things which we call useful; it merely expresses their relations
to the pains and pleasures of mankind.”<a href="#_ftn108" name="_ftnref108"
title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[108]</span></span></span></a>  
Thus, ratios of exchange, prices of commodities, are entirely dependent upon
their relation to the pains and pleasures of mankind, which are the “ultimate
objects of the Calculus of Economics.”  To state the character of this
dependence requires the idea of marginal utility which is derived from the law
of diminishing utility.  The utility of additional units of a commodity
progressively decreases as consumption is extended.  And it is here that
scarcity enters the picture, for, the more there is of a commodity in the
market, the less is the utility of the last-added unit.  When the supply is
extended to where the utility of the last is no more and no less than the
utility [58] of the last unit of any other commodity, the market is in
equilibrium.  This is the situation toward which the forces of the market drive
ratios of exchange because as long as equilibrium does not exist, an increased
utility can be gained by exchanging the comparatively excessive commodity for
the comparatively scarce one and by shifting production from the former to the
latter.  The desire to maximize utility thus drives the productive factors
toward supplying<a href="#_ftn109" name="_ftnref109" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[109]</span></span></span></a>  the commodity which is being
exchanged for the greater utility and thus toward equilibrium, not only in the
consumer’s goods market but also between various kinds of capital goods and between
the factors of production.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:5.0pt; text-indent:-5.0pt'>            Then
how is this optimum situation reached?  The obvious answer must be to avoid
obstructing or interfering with the natural forces that bring it about.  Those
forces spring from basic human nature and cannot even be estimated except
through their results in terms of price<a href="#_ftn110" name="_ftnref110"
title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[110]</span></span></span></a> in an
unobstructed competitive market.  Jevons’ general theory, like those of his
predecessors, clearly dictates <u>laissez faire</u>.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:5.0pt; text-indent:-5.0pt'>            By
accepting the utility theory of value and by restricting the theory of
valuation to the free-market determination of ratios of exchange, Jevons
clearly placed himself in the [59] position of being unable to find logical
warrant for government ownership either in his general theory of economics or
on any other basis.  This is necessarily the case since there could be no way
to determine the efficacy of the government ownership of any economic
enterprise except that the enterprise be called into being and operated in
accordance with the conditions of a free and competitive market, in which event
there could be no occasion for government ownership because the greatest
utility would be forthcoming already.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:5.0pt; text-indent:-5.0pt'>            But

way of depending on price in a free and competitive market as the only measure

competitive price.  However, problems which were obviously economic and which
could not be resolved on the basis of competitive price demanded attention.  If
economic problems were not to be considered in terms of economic theory, then
in what terms were they to be considered?  If general economic theory could not

serve?</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>                        This
impasse stimulated many students to reconsider the [61] general theory in terms

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>                        The

utilities and disutilities are the forces behind exchange ratios.  They are the
motivating influences which cause man to act toward equilibrating the market
impact of their respective marginal units.  It is only the market impact of the
marginal unit of any item that is brought into equilibrium with the market
impact of the marginal unit of every other item.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>                        [62]
In Marshall’s analysis, decreasing utility and increasing disutility operate
through demand and supply respectively to drive prices toward the point which
equilibrates the market force of the two.  In reference to the instantaneous
picture, this equilibration requires little demonstration.  In fact, in the
instantaneous view, it is a truism; whatever forces cause exchange ratios to be
what they are have most assuredly expended their causal action in so far as
they affect exchange ratios that exist at the moment.  Supply and demand are
thus set up as the sole determinants of exchange rations where the supply is
given and the current demand schedule does not have time to shift in response
to other influences.<a href="#_ftn116" name="_ftnref116" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[116]</span></span></span></a>   This is called the “market
price.”  It is the value on the demand schedule that corresponds to the
quantity of the given supply.  Costs, real or money, can have no influence on
the immediate situation because they cannot affect either the existing supply
or the demand schedule.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>                        But
if time is introduced into the equation, then costs play a determining part. 
In the “short period,” which Marshall designated as the projection of the period
within which the factors of production may be assumed to remain constant, the
supply is driven toward, but does not reach, that quantity for which the
corresponding value on the demand schedule just [63] equals the marginal supply
price based upon current costs of production.<a href="#_ftn117"
name="_ftnref117" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>                        In
the “long period” which Marshall defined as long enough to permit adjustment of
the factors, the forces of supply and demand are able to work out their balance
in terms of almost full adjustment to the revised costs of the factors and
their reciprocal influences by expected demand schedules.<a href="#_ftn118"
name="_ftnref118" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[118]</span></span></span></a>  
This period is constituted by the longest-range expectancies that entrepreneurs
can ordinarily be expected to make.  Because of the full opportunity to
reorganize, to adjust labor force and plant, and to duplicate or renew plant,
the supply, under competitive conditions, is pushed to the quantity which can
be sold at the supply price based upon costs under the extended readjustment. 
The free play of demand and supply in the market is assumed to effect these
adjustments.<a href="#_ftn119" name="_ftnref119" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[119]</span></span></span></a>   Under these conditions, the
supply price is that which just covers the costs of the factors.  This is
Marshall’s <u>normal</u> price.  It is the price toward which adjustments are
made.  The factor costs which comprise the normal price are the prices that
bring into equilibrium the market values of the disutilities involved in
providing the factors at the margin and the market values of [64] the utilities
which their receipts can procure. </p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>                        This
equilibrium price is never reached in the real economy.  Particularly constant
is the disequilibrium between various industries.  The failure to attain
general equilibrium results from imperfections in the market process and from
the changes which occur over Marshall’s fourth and longest time period.<a

class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[120]</span></span></span></a>  
The changes involved here are those of the basic economic data such as
population, knowledge, techniques of production and distribution, general
enlightenment, and institutional structure.  These changes are not controlled
by the market forces but they have the effect of continuously changing the
points of equilibrium toward which market values are driven.  These changes
specify the secular trend in exchange ratios.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>                        It
is extremely difficult to give a short, sequential statement of Marshall’s
general theory.  His extension of the marginal utility analysis, through the
use of time periods, to account for changes over time and his synthesis of the
cost and the utility analyses were productive of many concepts which have been
important tools in subsequent developments.  But just what Marshall considered
to be the effects of those concepts on his general theory is not clear.  Some
of those concepts, for example “consumers’ surplus,”<a href="#_ftn121"

is impossible to say whether or not Marshall considered his general theory to
be <u>general</u> in the sense that it was an analysis of the inclusive and
continuing factors in the economic process.  He clearly stated that the
analysis must be restricted to the market process but that that process cannot
be thought of as displaying the real economic operations.  But he also stated
that the market analysis can divulge the “normal” situation only when supply
and demand are allowed free and unrestricted play.  These clearly are claims to
generality.  The latter statement together with the dictum that the real
values’ only available common measure is price and that therefore we are forced
to use price “with all its defects” would seem to dictate the <u>laissez-faire</u>
position.  For, if economic realities can be seen only through price, and if
price permits [66] the observation only when demand and supply have free play,
then it would seem that there would be no way to judge an economic operation if
those conditions did not prevail.  But Marshall concluded on this point:</p>

<p class=Body style=' text-indent:1.0pt'>            The
present writer is convinced that Marshall did not in fact believe that
non-price determinations in economic matters are either invalid or unavailable
in any sense, even in the sense and to the extent in which price determinations
were both valid and available, although his statement of the [67] general
theory specifically includes that dictum.  Marshall frequently relied on
non-price determinations in analyzing economic problems.  For example, he
relied on non-price determinations in his analysis of the propriety of the
government installation and operation of certain enterprises in which the cost
schedule is <u>always</u> above the price schedule.<a href="#_ftn129"

<p class=Body style=' text-indent:1.0pt'>            In the
example just cited, Marshall indicated that if the consumers’ surplus in an
enterprise is greater than the aggregate loss in money, the enterprise should
be installed and financed through taxation.  This same principle applied also
to enterprises in which the cost schedule is below the demand schedule only at
some points.<a href="#_ftn130" name="_ftnref130" title=""><span

industries could be operated, with monopoly restrictions, at a profit, the
maximization of consumers’ surplus above aggregate costs may be attained by
setting price below cost in case the increase in the consumers’ surplus
continues to be more rapid than the increase in costs beyond the point where
costs equal demand price.</p>

<p class=Body style=' text-indent:1.0pt'>            But the
consumers’ surplus is identified as the difference between the aggregate of
what consumers must pay for the whole supply of an item and the aggregate of
what they <u>would have been willing</u> to pay if the supply were introduced
into the market unit by unit  but if sales were not effected until the given
[68] supply had been reached.<a href="#_ftn131" name="_ftnref131" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[131]</span></span></span></a>   This identification of
consumers’ surplus does not violate Marshall’s general tenet that the
incidences of the various forces can be estimated only in price or
exchange-ratio terms.  And it does not violate the general tenet that such
estimations of the real forces antecedent to price can be made only by
observing the free play of supply and demand, for much experiential evidence of
the shape of cost and demand schedules in some enterprises can be determined
under those conditions.  But it does violate, strangely enough, the general
tenet that price cannot be conceived as representing any actual comparisons
between the real forces which are antecedent to price.  Consumers’ surplus is
presented here as a real situation, as a situation having substance beyond the
market process itself.</p>

<p class=Body style=' text-indent:1.0pt'>            It is
this disclaim of congruity between price and real economic process combined
with the positive claim that price is the only available criterion in that
process - it is this combination that distinguishes Marshall’s general theory. 
It permitted him to disavow the ethics of hedonism and at the same time to
continue using the conceptual tools of the hedonistic calculus.  In the
instances in which the maximization of consumers’ surplus serves as one of
Marshall’s criteria for government ownership, the disavowal of the ethics of
hedonism [69] is abandoned.  In this case, it is precisely the maximization of
psychological satisfaction that gives warrant to the criterion.</p>

<p class=Body style=' text-indent:1.0pt'>            Marshall
found another criterion of policy regarding government ownership in the
relation between risk and expected returns.  The schedule of the supply price
in certain industries may be raised completely beyond the demand schedule
because of the risks that must be borne by the entrepreneur.  If the supply
price minus profits in such enterprises places the cost schedule below the
demand schedule, then a real gain could be made if the undue risks could be
eliminated.  Situations of this sort are most apt to arise in developing
particular natural resources which are isolated or are otherwise situated in
relation to the business community so that entire communities must be built in
order to bring the enterprise into being.  On this point, Marshall concluded:</p>

<p class=Body style=' text-indent:1.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.5in; text-indent:-35.0pt'>            In
those exceptional branches of production for which a government can found </p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.5in; text-indent:-35.0pt'>            a
manufacturing town without incurring the risks that a private firm would incur </p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.5in; text-indent:-35.0pt'>            in
a similar case, that point of advantage may fairly be reckoned as an argument </p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.5in; text-indent:-35.0pt'>            for
Governments undertaking those particular businesses.<a href="#_ftn132"
name="_ftnref132" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[132]</span></span></span></a> </p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.5in; text-indent:-35.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>This principle, if
applied to its extremest possibilities, would result in the government
establishing and operating any and every enterprise where the cost schedule
could be calculated to fall, at any point, below the demand schedule and where
private [70] firms have not begun operations.  The fact that private firms have
not begun operations would be, in light of Marshall’s general theory, proof
that the private entrepreneur’s supply price is above the demand schedule. 
But, on the other hand, Marshall’s general theory indicates also that if the
demand schedule could be determined to be above the cost schedule, then the
supply price would, for that reason, fall to or below the demand schedule and
the required private investment would be forthcoming.  In relation to
Marshall’s general theory, this principle of government ownership seems to be
equivalent to saying that gains could be made by the government ownership of
certain enterprises under certain conditions but that when those conditions
could be determined, private enterprise would appear and the conditions no
longer would prevail.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            In the
case of “indivisible” undertakings, or “natural monopolies” Marshall decided
that government control generally is preferable to government ownership.<a
href="#_ftn133" name="_ftnref133" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[133]</span></span></span></a>  
His reason for this decision is that control could still allow for the
initiative that accompanies ownership.  But in some such enterprises,</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:37.0pt; '>... when a large
use of rights of way, especially in public streets is necessary, it </p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:37.0pt; '>is doubtless
generally best to retain the ownership, if not the management </p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:37.0pt; '>of the inevitable
monopoly in public hands.<a href="#_ftn134" name="_ftnref134" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=Body style='margin-left:37.0pt; '>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>[71] At this point,
two conditions are prescribed that may render a monopoly a proper subject of
government ownership: first, it must be an inevitable monopoly, and second, it
must have very wide patronage.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            This
idea is founded outside his general theory on both counts.  The inevitability
that Marshall had in mind is a function of the physical situation.  It is
determined entirely outside the market process.  The “large use” aspect too is
a matter of physical requirement, not a matter of price.  What Marshall seemed
to be thinking of in this connection is the physical necessity of large use,”
as in the case of streets where the use is not a matter of price, even in the
monopoly sense of the word.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            Marshall’s
idea of monopoly itself is not founded in his general theory.  In the case </p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>of an inevitable
monopoly, the unity of organization and operation is a matter of physical
situation; in the case of an unnatural monopoly, the unity of organization and
operation is the effect of special privilege maintained either by law or
forceful concealment.  The relation of monopoly to Marshall's general theory is
its contrast with that theory.  His theory of monopoly price may be contrasted
with his theory of competitive price in that the latter displays forces working
out toward an equilibrium that is “normal,” that is in some sense an optimum
situation; whereas the former displays forces working out toward an equilibrium
that is abnormal, that is in some sense sub-optimum.  The abnormality aspect
does not lie in [72] the notion that in monopoly the free play of the forces
behind supply and demand do not have complete effect, for they play as strongly
and as effectively there as they do in competition, and their effects are even
more definitive.  The difference is that those forces work out an ill effect in
monopoly and a good effect in competition.  There is no way to avoid the
identity of competition and normalcy and efficacy in Marshall’s general theory.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            It is
not surprising, then, to reflect that Marshall, like his predecessors, founded
each of his determinants of government ownership outside his general theory.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            Marshall
was much concerned with the real economic problems of his day;<a href="#_ftn135"

his exercise over those concerns and in those practical engagements Marshall
evidently was convinced that his “general principles” were not in fact
statements of the continuing and inclusive factors in the economic process
although his statement of the theory seems to require that interpretation.  He
had a strong sense of institutional evolution, and he evidently held the notion
that the classical general theory, though stated as fundamental, was not more
than a special theory containing no continuing fundamentals.  [73] In a letter
to Professor C. R. Fay, concerning the period 1920-1970, he wrote: “I believe

economic principles.  That is to say, through the period during which the
living-getting process has been clearly and separately designated as an area of
inquiry, the classical statement of the pattern of the continuing and inclusive
factors in that process has held the widest credence.</p>

the classical theory at any stage of its development.  Without exception, the

<p class=Body style=' text-indent:1.0pt'>Evidently, something
other than receipts from sales is intended in Smith’s statement because he
includes education, highways, streets, harbors, etc. under this principle.  He
seems to have had in mind some other basis for determining the repayment to

observes, may, and frequently do, gain a profit directly from the sale of services.</p>

<p class=Body style=' text-indent:1.0pt'>            In
speaking of the general category of non-private enterprise, Smith states that

<p class=Body style=' text-indent:1.0pt'>            John
Stuart Mill extended and organized the analysis of government ownership.  His
principles are as follows: (1) If the consumer of the enterprise cannot
exercise his full discretionary function, either because of inability to
understand or inability to pay or because he is under the autocratic authority
of another person, the enterprise is properly subject to government ownership. 
(2) The government should interfere in those cases in which no amount of wisdom
and discretion is sufficient to foresee the ultimate consequences of a decision
in contract.  (3) If the necessary organization of an enterprise divorces
ownership and control beyond the degree of divorcement between the citizen and
the  government, then the enterprise is better carried on by the government.
(4) Natural monopolies should be government-owned or they should be controlled
to attain the same results. (5) The government should do whatever is necessary
to give effect to the individual’s recognized interests if those interests
require collective action and if that action cannot be effective without
government action or forceful sanction.  (6) If the service is highly valuable
but does not activate individuals toward purchase because its benefits are
indirect and evenly spread, the enterprise is properly a government function.</p>

<p class=Body style=' text-indent:1.0pt'>            W.
Stanley Jevons developed no principles of government [76] ownership but he
stated four conditions “under which state management of any branch of industry
is successful.”  They are as follows: (1) invariable and routine-like nature,
(2) complete public information and observation of the operation, (3) low
capital expenditure, and (4) inherent character that permits incorporation into
the government to “lead to great advantage and economy.”</p>

<p class=Body style=' text-indent:1.0pt'>            Alfred
Marshall’s principles of government ownership grow directly out of his theory
of consumers’ surplus and his theory of monopoly.  His first principle is that
if the maximization of consumers’ surplus over total costs involves setting
price below cost, then the enterprise is a fit subject of government
ownership.  Marshall’s second principle is that monopolies which are inevitable
and which have a very wide patronage may be proper subjects for government
ownership.  He preferred regulation rather than government ownership of
monopolies.  The distinguishing factor he had in mind seems to be simply the
physical situation which requires constant and very wide patronage of an
indivisible industry.</p>

<p class=Body style=' text-indent:1.0pt'>            The
general frame of reference in terms of which the problem of government
ownership was approached changed considerably from 1776 to 1890.  Adam Smith
framed his treatment generally in terms of the effect that the government
ownership of a particular enterprise would have on the remainder of the
economy.  Senior and Mill approached the problem from the standpoint of the
comparative efficiency of the government-[77]ownership of a particular
enterprise and the private ownership of the same enterprise.  Mill, especially,
sought out the factors that would indicate the superior internal efficiency of
the government ownership of a particular enterprise.  Marshall considered the
problem of comparative internal efficiency.  But his primary concern was the
development of analytical tools which would be useful in studying the problem
from the standpoint of maximizing utilities under the assumption that internal
efficiency could be achieved under either form of ownership.</p>

<p class=Body style=' text-indent:1.0pt'>            During
the century in which the classical theory was being developed into its present
form, the Underconsumption analysis held the attention of very few economists. 
It received its initial inclusive statement at the hands of Thomas Robert
Malthus soon after the appearance of Ricardo’s <u>Principles</u>, and it was
maintained in essentially its original form until the depression of the 1930s
forced economists to reconsider the general idea which distinguishes the
underconsumption analysis.</p>

<p class=Body style=' text-indent:1.0pt'>            That
general idea is that the free market does not work out full use of the factors
of production.  The classical theory has been seen to incorporate the dictum that
an unrestrained, competitive market results in all-out production under
conditions of full employment of all the factors.  That dictum is disputed by
the underconsumption theory.</p>

<p class=Body style=' text-indent:1.0pt'>            The
underconsumption theory’s claim to generality lies in the same assumption which
serves the classical theory in that regard.  Both theories assume that the
market process, and therefore the economic process, can be explained in terms
of price alone.  They differ only in that they offer different [79]
explanations of how the economic process works out through price.</p>

class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[154]</span></span></span></a> 
And this varying value of the produce of capital depends on the abundance of

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            Then,
since the “abundance of labour” is given by the law of population, the analysis
requires a theory of capital formation so that the required comparisons can be
made.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            Malthus
agreed with the classical analysis that capital formation can come only from
savings.<a href="#_ftn156" name="_ftnref156" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[156]</span></span></span></a>   But he contended that
savings are, as such only one half of the supply-demand picture.  The other
side is “effectual demand.”  He pointed out that investment is made only in the
prospect of profits from the eventual produce.<a href="#_ftn157"
name="_ftnref157" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[157]</span></span></span></a>  Then
the actual rate of investment depends upon the maintenance of effective demand
for the [83] eventual produce.  This demand cannot come entirely from wages,
for, if wages were equal to the total produce, there would be no profits.  And
the difference cannot come out of profits because there would then be no
savings.  The difference could come only from non-productive expenditure. 
Therefore, the only way to insure continued effective demand, and thereby
profits, would be to maintain a large, non-productive expenditure.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            In all
of this there is implied the inequality of savings and investment.  On this
matter, Malthus stated:</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.5in; text-indent:-35.0pt'>            Almost

<p class=Body style='margin-left:2.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>It
is not clear whether Malthus meant that effective demand would fail only if
saving exceeded investment or that all profits require equivalent
non-productive expenditure.  His statement seems to shift from one view to the
other.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:2.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>            But,
in any event, the actual open-market process is pictured as inherently
incompatible with all-out production.  Periods of prosperity bring on
depression.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:2.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>            Because
of his view of the disrapport within the free-market process, it is to be
expected that Malthus would not support the <u>laissez-faire</u>, position.  In
this connection he pointed out that the government cannot avoid the necessity
of taxation and that even this requirement makes it “impossible [84] for a
government strictly to let things take their natural course.”<a href="#_ftn159"
name="_ftnref159" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[159]</span></span></span></a>  But
Malthus’ primary concern was with demonstrating the necessity of a large
non-productive” expenditure such as could be made by landowners, and so he did
not go into the matter of other avenues of non-investment expenditures beyond
mentioning them as possible aids.  His theory could serve merely as the point
of departure for alternative programs.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:2.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>            The
underconsumption theory as propounded by Malthus is concerned with the problem
of the level of employment.  His approach to that problem was made through the
idea of “gluts” or over-supply, the idea that goods are produced which cannot
be sold.  This idea involves the necessity of disproving Say’s Law, because if
supply creates its own demand, then without doubt no such thing as an
over-supply could possibly exist.  The underconsumptionist approach to that
attack is through an effort to disprove Adam Smith’s dictum that what is saved
is as readily spent as what is consumed, “and nearly in the same time too, but
by a different set of people.”  For, if all receipts from sales were spent as
rapidly as received, and if the expenditure on capital investment preceded the
sales of the eventuating commodities, then quite obviously there could be no
production in the aggregate which could not be sold in the aggregate.  Say’s
Law would hold.  The analysis therefore came [85] to be founded on the
inequality between savings and investment.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:2.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>            Proceeding
from excess savings to failure of effective demand remained the sequence in the
underconsumption analysis of the level of employment until 1936.  During that
time, Malthus’ distinction between landed capital and industrial capital was
dropped, and with it the argument for high rents.  But the analysis continued
to rest, at bottom, on the idea that savings exceed investment.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:2.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>            In
1936, John Maynard Keynes published a somewhat different analysis of the same
general problem in terms of the market determinants of the level of
employment.  In <u>the General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money</u>,
Keynes outlined his problem somewhat as follows:<a href="#_ftn160"
name="_ftnref160" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[160]</span></span></span></a>  (1)
The rate of both real income and money income depends on the level of
employment.  (2) The rate of consumption varies in the same direction as the
rate of income, but at a lower rate.  (3) The rate of net income is the sum of
the rate of sales of investment goods and the rate of sales of consumers’
goods.  (4) Therefore, at any given level of employment, there must be a rate
of investment equal to the difference between the rate of income and the rate
of consumption.  (5) Therefore, the level of employment depends upon the
propensity [86] to consume and the rate of investment.  (6) But the rate of
investment depends on the relation between the marginal efficiency of capital
and the rate of interest.  (7) Therefore, the level of employment depends on
the propensity to consume, the marginal efficiency of capital, and the rate of
interest.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:2.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>            The
propensity to consume at any given level of income depends on what Keynes
called certain “objective factors” and certain “subjective factors.”<a
href="#_ftn161" name="_ftnref161" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[161]</span></span></span></a>  
The objective factors are such things as changes in government fiscal policy,
changes in money wage-rates, and windfall changes in capital values.  The
subjective factors are characterized as precaution, foresight, calculation,
improvement, independence, enterprise, and pride and avarice.  </p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:2.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>Social,
government, and business institutions are influenced by prospective expansion
of investment, safety in emergencies, etc.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:2.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>            Keynes
came to the conclusion that the propensity to consume at any given level if
income is a fairly stable factor, at least for the reasonably short view.  It
varies noticeably with changes in the level of income but is comparatively
stable for any given level of income.<a href="#_ftn162" name="_ftnref162"

<p class=Body style='margin-left:2.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>As
long as this rate of return exceeds the rate of interest, the entrepreneur has
a real motive for extending his purchases of the capital asset.  But the
extension of investment in any capital asset reduces its marginal efficiency
and so ultimately brings it into approximate equality with the rate of
interest.  The investment-demand schedule then is the schedule of investment
which brings the marginal efficiency of capital into equality with the rate of
interest.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:2.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>            The
rate of interest is not the same thing as the marginal efficiency of capital
although equilibrium is established only when they have the same numerical
rate-value.  The rate of interest is defined as the price paid for the use of
money; it is that price which brings into equilibrium the demand for and the
supply of money.<a href="#_ftn164" name="_ftnref164" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[164]</span></span></span></a>   Thus it is in contrast with
the classical theory which conceives interest to be the price which
equilibrates the demand for and the supply of savings.  Keynes reasoned that
since interest is the price paid for parting with liquid control over money,
and since all money is held by someone all the time, interest obviously is the
price which brings the liquidity preference into equality with the quantity of
money.  Interest equilibrates the demand [88] for and the supply of money.  The
supply of money is determined by banking policy and by government fiscal
policy; the demand for money is motivated by the need of cash for transacting
business, the desire for security, and the desire to gain, if opportunity
occurs, by being in the immediate possession of cash.<a href="#_ftn165"
name="_ftnref165" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span

<p class=Body style='margin-left:2.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>            The
propensity to consume, the marginal efficiency of capital and the rate of
interest are thus independently determined.  They, in combination, determine
the level of employment.  And the level of employment may be at any point
between starvation and full employment.  There is thus no way for the marginal
disutility of working to be brought into equilibrium with the marginal
productivity of labor except by accident or by controlling one or more of the
determining factors.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:2.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>            In
the Keynesian analysis, the causal relation between savings and investment is
reversed in its direction of action.  Savings and investment remain necessarily
equal, but decisions to invest determine the level of savings rather than the other
way around. Decisions not to spend merely reduce income, for there is no
automatic adjustment in the price system which would transfer income not spent
on consumption into capital expansion.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:2.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>            Keynes’
theory in itself gives no basis for government [89] policy.  But when it is
considered in connection with the assumption that the <u>sine</u> <u>qua</u> <u> non</u>
of all economic considerations is that the economic process be kept going, then
this theory suggests definite policy in the matter of government ownership. 
Its author made that assumption, and he drew several conclusions in that

theory is an analysis of the internal working of the open-market process.  It
pictures that process as defective in that it cannot maintain sufficient
effective demand to maintain full employment.  The concept of defectiveness is
drawn from the conviction that continuity and efficiency of the economic
process is the all-important basis for any sort of economic theorizing.  In
that conviction, Keynes was able to say, in light of his theory, that, since
the market process cannot alone maintain the requisites of its own continuance,
deliberate measures must be taken to correct the deficiency.  His theory also
furnishes a quantitative measure of whatever governmental intrusions are
adopted.  But his theory offered [91] him no guide as to which enterprises or
what kind of enterprise should be the points of intrusion, and he therefore
refrained from making any pronouncements on that matter.  A great many
proposals for particular government enterprises have claimed basis in the
Keynesian analysis.  But their basis in that theory is restricted to the
necessity for government expenditure; they can find in it no warrant for being

<p class=Body  >            The term
“institutionalist” customarily has been applied to a group of American
economists whose theoretical outlook seemed to stem from the work of Thorstein
Veblen.  Out of this group, during the first three decade of the current
century, there was promise of a new school of economic thought.  But the
theoretical formulations of the persons in that group have diverged so greatly
that the identification of a separate school seems to have disappeared.  The
members of what was called the institutionalist school have dispersed into the
contemporary complex.</p>

<p class=Body  >            But the effects of
Veblen’s work have not played out.  On the contrary, they have entered importantly
into the contemporary complex.  Not only has Veblen’s analysis been furthered
directly in the line of his basic concepts, but also his criticisms of the
various bodies of economic theory have [92] enforced a skepticism and
consequently a reexamination that still is in ferment.</p>

<p class=Body  >            Veblen’s provoking,
critical analyses of the several systems of received doctrine placed him at
once in the role of a dissenter, but not the kind of dissenter with whom the
orthodox were accustomed to deal.  He dissented not only from the orthodox but
also from the dissenters in that he proposed no pattern of economic
institutions which would be the proper pattern, and no such pattern could be
given foundation in what his theory indicated.  The heterodox, both
revolutionary and non-revolutionary, had always used the terms, categories, and
much of the same conceptuology used by the orthodox.  And, as in the case of
orthodox theory, some particular pattern of institutional arrangements had
always found warrant in each dissenting general theory.  But Veblen insisted
that those categories and that conceptuology were insufficient and in part
irrelevant to the general economic theory.<a href="#_ftn170" name="_ftnref170"

lessened by the character of Veblen’s writing.  He wrote “piece-meal,” in terms

fashion.</p>

<p class=Body  >            The piece-meal character

Veblen himself.</p>

permit him to display the “penetrating insight” with which he has been credited.</p>

<p class=Body style=' text-indent:1.0pt'>            Veblen’s

Thus Veblen thought that any adjustment of an economic institution, whether by
gradual habituation or by deliberate choice, is contingent on that adjustment’s
effective correlation with the physical provision of the material means of
life.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            This
theory conceivably could be applied to the broader aspects of institutional
adjustment and to the most minute adjustments - for example, price variations. 
Veblen thus makes it more than a suspicion that <u>all</u> economic problems
are problems of institutional adjustment.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            It is
for that reason that his work is particularly significant to a study of the
theoretical foundations of government ownership in a capitalistic economy. For
the problem of government ownership in such an economy obviously is a problem
of institutional adjustment.  If the run of the facts in the sample of
government-owned enterprises selected for this study fall into the pattern of Veblen’s
theory, they will constitute added evidence of the validity of that general
theory; if the run of the facts do not fall into that pattern, then the
converse will obtain.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            Veblen
left his general theory at the state of “making up one’s account with the
material conditions which converge to bring it (adjustment) on.”  The extension
of that theory [97] has been in determining how that account is made up; the
refinement of that theory has been in clarifying the concepts of the
“institutional” and the “technological” aspects of the economy.  The only
published effort to further Veblen’s general theory on both counts has been
made </p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>by Professor C. E.
Ayres of the University of Texas.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            Professor
Ayres’ extension of the theory of institutional adjustment is made on two
fronts both of which enter into the determination of how the “account with the
material conditions” is “made up.”</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            The
first of these two fronts is the theory of value, the theory of that in terms
of which the account may be drawn.  Professor Ayres draws the Veblenian
distinction between the technological and institutional aspects of the economy
in light of more recent developments in the theory of knowledge<a

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:35.0pt; text-indent:-34.0pt'>            For
every man the real and valid judgments of economic value are those he makes
between purchases, judgments of value in use as economists once said, tested
and verified by the way things work in the continuous effort of existence.  It
is to this test that all economic values are in fact submitted, those of public
policy affecting the industrial system as a whole no less than those of private
life.  For every individual and for the community the criterion of value is the
continuation of the life-process - keeping the machines running.  That is what
we have in fact been doing throughout the ages, and that is what we must
continue [98] to do and do continually better - technologically better - if we
are to continue and exceed the achievements of the past.<a href="#_ftn182"

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>Professor Ayres
makes it clear that the one thing without which there is nothing at all in the
economic sense is the continuity of the economic process.  Indeed, a reference
back to this basis is forced by the run of the physical facts.  For it is
obvious that any criterion of value in terms of which action is taken which contravenes
the continuity of the economic process thereby cancels all human action,
including the action taken under those terms.  It is proposed, then, that
economic estimation be made directly in terms of the criterion which the run of
the facts dictates.  Professor Ayres views the character of that dictation much
as the curvature of a lens is dictated by its function in the process in which
it plays a part.  The problem posed by any disrapport between the lens
grinder’s predilection concerning proper concavity or convexity on the one hand
and the dictation of the facts on the other hand can be resolved only by an
adjustment of the predilections.  In this same sense, Professor Ayres points
out that the locus of economic value is in the economic process, not in
predilections drawing warrant from any other source.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            Something
of this same conception of value is implicit in most of Veblen’s work, and he
tacitly applies it in almost all of his discussion.  But his view of science as
being [99] motivated by “idle curiosity” blocked any logical way to a theory of
value drawn in terms dictated by the run of the facts.  For if science is valid
only as an exercise of idle curiosity, although its content is dictated by the
run of the facts, there is no way to base the validity of science itself in the
same sort of mental processes with which it examines and explains the facts.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            The
second front on which Professor Ayres extends the Veblenian theory of
institutional adjustment is the determination of what particular adjustments
are made.  This determination comes to focus in what Professor Ayres calls “the
power of ideas.”<a href="#_ftn183" name="_ftnref183" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[183]</span></span></span></a> </p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            Many
students of Veblen’s writings have got the impression that institutional
adjustments, being changes in the “settled habits of thought common to the
generality of men,” are altogether a matter of unconsciously modified
habituation. From this point, the conclusion sometimes has been drawn that
changes in <u>structural</u> institutions are exclusively unreasoned changes in
habits.  Professor Ayres points out that ideas are the immediate point of
departure for adjustments in structural institutions, that is, in the
prescribed relations of a group of people organized for definite purposes.”<a
href="#_ftn184" name="_ftnref184" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[184]</span></span></span></a>
</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            But he
points out also that two kinds of ideas are [100] involved.<a href="#_ftn185"
name="_ftnref185" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[185]</span></span></span></a>  On
the one hand, conceptual formulations based on the authority of personalities
serve toward maintaining the existing rules of the game.  On the other hand,
ideas arising as conceptual formulations of the material economic process serve
toward changing the rules of the game as the material conditions of the
economic process change.  Either way, the pattern of ideas is the immediate
prescription of the pattern of human relations, and any change in the former is
the immediate prescription of a change in the latter.  Professor Ayres’
contribution at this point is that the causal potency of an idea based on the
authority of personalities is a function of the coercive power of those
personalities, whereas the causal potency of an idea based on the run of the facts
in causal terms is a function of the correctness of the idea.  The former,
Professor Ayres identifies as non-causal or metaphysical; the latter, he
identifies as science.  Metaphysical ideas have no potency in themselves; the
source of their potency is exterior to the ideas.  Scientific ideas are potent
as such.<a href="#_ftn186" name="_ftnref186" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[186]</span></span></span></a>   Then it is the interplay of
these two forces that determines the pattern of any adjustment.  Professor
Ayres concludes that there is no way, short of total destruction, in which
metaphysics can prevent the encroachment, however gradual, of science as a way
of [101] understanding and therefore specifying the patterns of human
relationships.<a href="#_ftn187" name="_ftnref187" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[187]</span></span></span></a>  And the reason for this is
that the inherently developmental character of science means that it constantly
proliferates beyond its immediate boundaries.<a href="#_ftn188"
name="_ftnref188" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[188]</span></span></span></a>  As a
way of explanation, science encroaches upon new areas and therefore specifies
the trespassed area.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            The
principle is simply that a pattern of human relations requires that the
individuals involved in the pattern comprehend their respective parts in it. 
If the players in a game do not understand the rules, as those rules apply to
them, then there can be no game.  A pattern of correlated human activities
requires that the persons whose activities are correlated understand their
respective parts in the pattern of correlation.  Otherwise the correlation
breaks down.  Structural institutions are patterns of correlated human
activities in both the metaphysical and scientific senses and therefore come
under this principle.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            The
institutionalist theory, as it now stands, may be outlined as follows: (1)
Economics is concerned with the living-getting process.  (2) The area of that
process for which economics seeks to provide explanation and understanding is
the pattern of human relationships.  (3) The pattern of human [103]
relationships takes visible form in structural institutions.  (4) Structural
institutions serve two kinds of functions: on the one hand, they serve to
express and to give effect to the pattern of invidious distinctions among the
persons who make up the institution; on the other hand, they serve as the
organizational devices through which human activities are directed to, and give
effect in, the process of providing the material means of life.  (5) These two
functions are the visible results of two different kinds of mental operations:
the invidious-differentiation function and the “rules of the game” which give
it effect are the result of conceptual operations which are based on, and seek
optimum correspondence with, a preconception of the ultimate correctness of a
pattern of invidious differentiation; the material-effect function and the
“rules of the game” which give it effect are the results of conceptual
operations which are based on, and seek optimum correspondence with, the run of
the facts in the process of providing the material means of life.  (6)
Therefore, the character of a structural institution is the resultant of the
interplay of these two ways of thinking, the former seeking optimum fidelity to
a preconceived situation, the latter seeking optimum correlation, or
efficiency, in an inherently developmental process.  (7) The
adjustment-determining power of the kind of thinking based on a certain pattern
of invidious differentiation is a function of the coercive power of the persons
giving active support to that pattern; the adjustment-[103]determining power of
the kind of thinking based on the efficiency of the economic process is a
function of the scientific correctness of the pattern of ideas.  (8) The points
of encroachment are specified by the emergence of the scientific understanding
of any particular relation in the institutional structure on the part of the
persons whose relations comprise the structure of the institution.  (9) Therefore,
the pattern of adjustment is prescribed by the pattern of encroachment on the
non-efficiency-determined portions of the structure by the scientific method of
explanation and therefore understanding and therefore verification and
therefore specification in the minds of those persons whose relationships are
specified in the structural institution.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            This
general theory is an explanation of the process of institutional adjustment. 
As such, it says nothing about the immediate procedures through which adjustments
are effected. But it discloses that the latter is a matter of the devices used
by those persons who actively support an established pattern.  In the case in
which those persons use physical force, the procedure of adjustment involves
physical force; in the case in which those persons use persuasion, then the
procedure involves persuasion.  But in either case, the pattern of adjustment
is specified by the development of scientific understanding since that is the
only way in which the “account” can be “made up” with the physical
circumstances which converge to bring on the problematic situation requiring
adjustment.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            [104]
The theory outlined here presents two principles which may be applied directly
to the problem at hand.  The first principle is that the economic forces acting
toward the adjustment of an institution are set in motion by the institution’s
infringement on the technological efficiency of the developing economic process
and that the problematic character of the situation can be removed only by
adjustment of the institution toward conformity with the technological
situation in terms of technological efficiency.  It is convenient to call this
the principle of technological determination.  The second principle is that the
pattern of interdependence which is recognized by the people whose actions are
correlated in a structural institution determines the specific character of the
institution.  It is convenient to call this the principle of recognized
interdependence.</p>

logical permission to restrict the study of economics to price analysis and at
the same time to disavow any meaning beyond price.  Thus, unshared significance
is conjoined with exemption from responsibility for explaining the economic
process.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            The
contemporary complex of economic theory is, in most part, the result of
developments which follow that pattern of justification.  The majority of
contemporary theoretical developments are exclusively price analysis.  Indeed,
few that are not exclusively concerned with price have gained much [106]
professional attention.  Most of the contemporary developments of price theory
have been directed toward refining the determination of equilibria toward which
the forces of the open market drive prices under various conditions.  Some such
developments are characterized as mere exercises of idle curiosity in
determining comparative prices in terms of other prices and are said to bear no
other significance although the equilibria are attained by the operation of the
basic forces which drive the economic process.  Those forces are the human
motive of utility and disutility (by whatever name).  Thus the Marshallian
conjoinment of significance and extra-price irresponsibility is maintained. 
Equilibrium becomes “just equilibrium.”<a href="#_ftn192" name="_ftnref192"

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            But the
contemporary developments in price theory which have received the widest
attention are those which are thought to have significance and importance in
that they give some indications of proper solutions of major economic problems
which confront contemporary society.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            The
Keynesian theory already has been mentioned in this [107] connection.<a

class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[194]</span></span></span></a>

equilibria of utility and disutility.<a href="#_ftn195" name="_ftnref195"
title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[195]</span></span></span></a>  And
that, at bottom, is why the Keynesian analysis is unable to indicate policy
without recourse to an outside theory of value.  And that also is why the
Keynesian analysis can consider the level of employment an involuntary
variable.  Its abandonment of the classical theory of value permits it to
consider the level of employment as a problem.  The theory of value to which
recourse is taken in Keynes’ discussion of policy is the same one that is
incorporated in the institutionalist theory - that is, the technological
efficiency of the economic process.  The meaning of the Keynesian analysis in
terms of price theory, as such, is not fundamentally significant.  In fact, the
position is stated explicitly that purchases (including labor) which enter as
costs in further sales are made on the basis of marginal productivity (in terms
of money price) of the items purchased.<a href="#_ftn196" name="_ftnref196"
title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[196]</span></span></span></a>  But,
as Keynes pointed out, this criterion is not possible where the costs or
receipts are not subject to pecuniary accountancy.  The points at which that
impossibility occurs are (1) where items (labor) are purchased which are not
supplied or withheld by virtue of comparative money costs and (2) where items
(consumers’ [108] goods) are purchased which do not themselves enter as money
costs in relation to further expectations of sales.  Both of these points are
where human life enters as one side of the transaction.  The first breaks down
the classical theory of wages because there is no way in which the marginal
disutility of working, however accounted, can be brought into equality with the
marginal productivity of labor.  The second breaks down the classical theory of
the rate of interest because efforts to consume (or conversely, to save) do not
have the same determinants as the rate of investment.  In both cases, the
classical theory breaks down where it cannot avoid directly representing human
motivation in terms of price.  Both disutility, when experienced directly by
people, and utility, when purchased directly for realization, show no tendency
to conform to the price pattern.  In the Keynesian view, the only things which
conform to the price pattern are prices.  Thus the Keynesian theory does no
violence to price theory as such; its infringement is on the price theory of
value.  The relation between the Keynesian analysis and the classical price
theory is one of correction; the relation between the Keynesian theory of the
level of employment and the classical theory of value is one of destruction.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            Another
contemporary development which has received wide attention and which has been
held to have significance (again, because of indications in regard to proper
policy) is the theory of monopolistic competition.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>However, he states
that the matter must be decided on the basis of comparative efficiency, that

<p class=Body style='margin-left:35.0pt; text-indent:-34.0pt'>            The
case for control is strongest when the monopolistic industry is, in great

such operation would make practicable an advantageous enlargement of the unit
of production.<a href="#_ftn209" name="_ftnref209" title=""><span

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            This
idea of the gains to be made in certain enterprises by enlargement of plant is
furthered by Professor R. H. Montgomery of the University of Texas.  His
general statement of this point is as follows:</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.5in; text-indent:-35.0pt'>            The
plant should be expanded as long as the output which would be taken </p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.5in; text-indent:-35.0pt'>            at
incremental cost can be produced at lower average cost.<a href="#_ftn210"
name="_ftnref210" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[210]</span></span></span></a> </p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>Where perfect competition
prevails this situation is presumed to be brought about because incremental
cost and average cost are identical at the point of lowest average cost.  But
where monopoly or monopolistic competition prevails, the individual enterprise
ordinarily operates under conditions of decreasing costs.  In that situation,
Professor Montgomery points out that, under the Marshallian assumptions
regarding the idea of consumers’ surplus, the maximization of community gains
is attained where incremental cost and the demand schedule have a [112] common
price-value per unit.<a href="#_ftn211" name="_ftnref211" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[211]</span></span></span></a>  Both Alfred Marshall and
Professor Pigou indicated this same conclusion. But Professor Montgomery points
out in extension that in case the relation of cost and the demand schedule is
such that the full use of existing plant permits profitable operation, and that
the plant, by extension, can continue to operate under conditions of decreasing
cost, then the plant should be extended until the quantity which can be sold at
incremental costs can no longer be produced at decreasing average costs.<a
href="#_ftn212" name="_ftnref212" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[212]</span></span></span></a>  
But in those enterprises in which the demand schedule is below the lowest point
on the average cost schedule, for the corresponding volume of production in the
extended plant, the extension of plant and the establishment of price at the
intersection of the demand and incremental-cost schedules results in permanent
losses to the owner.  Professor Montgomery concludes that unless the government
adopts the policy of providing facilities for competing firms the only way in
which the gains can be realized for the community is through government
ownership.<a href="#_ftn213" name="_ftnref213" title=""><span

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            Professor
Montgomery further points out that decreasing-cost industries are usually those
with proportionately high capital costs and that this circumstance inclines
entrepreneurs in such enterprises to restrict the introduction of new [113]
techniques.<a href="#_ftn214" name="_ftnref214" title=""><span

</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            Disrapport
between the policy indications of these theories of price under monopolistic
competition and under monopoly and the theory of competitive price is not
between the price theories as such. The differences in policy indications
result from the introduction of the idea that conditions of monopoly and
monopolistic competition are “normal” in that they occur under a general <u>laissez
-faire</u> policy.  It will be remembered that the classical theory of
competitive price stands on the assumption that the human motives in economic
activities find their most effective expression and exercise in the free
market.  The theories of monopoly price and monopolistic-competition price
stand on exactly the same assumption.  Also, these two types of price theory do
not disagree on the tenet that competitive price reflects the optimum
arrangement of the real economic factors and that where perfect competition
exists it forces that arrangement to come about.  The real difference lies in
the idea that there are technological factors which are [114] causally
antecedent to the institutional factors and which preclude institutional
adjustments that would permit competitive price to work out its optimum.  Thus
these theories of monopoly price and of monopolistic-competition price maintain
the competitive-price guide to the proper arrangement of the factors but
abandon the assumption that <u>laissez-faire</u> brings about that proper
arrangement.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            This
particular incidence of the technological situation on the free-market
determination of price results from the reduction of the possible number of
firms engaged in an industry.  For, it is because of the limited number of
firms that any individual firm can conceive the demand schedule of its product
as anything other than the market price.  The first inclusive statement of the
determination of price under the various conditions which limit the number of
firms was made by Professor Edward Chamberlin in 1928.<a href="#_ftn216"
name="_ftnref216" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[216]</span></span></span></a>  His
statement presents the determination of price at the point at which the cost
schedule has only one common value with the demand schedule.  In any case in
which there is a struggle for the market, and in which entry into the field is
free, the entry and exit of firms brings the demand schedule for each firm into
tangency with its cost schedule, and prices are driven to the point of
tangency.<a href="#_ftn217" name="_ftnref217" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[217]</span></span></span></a>   [115] But , since the
elasticity of the demand schedule for each firm is less than infinity, the
point of tangency is higher than the lowest value on the cost schedule, and the
volume of output is less than that which corresponds with the lowest cost.  If
free entry does not obtain, the struggle for the market, through adjusting
price and quality or through advertising outlays, produces the same results.<a
href="#_ftn218" name="_ftnref218" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[218]</span></span></span></a> 
The only way in which a profit can be assured is by having an advantage which
cannot be duplicated,<a href="#_ftn219" name="_ftnref219" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[219]</span></span></span></a> that is, by having an
absolute monopoly on some aspect of the operation.  The only alternative
assurance of a profit would be for all firms to refrain from a struggling for the
market through price, quality, character of product, or increased sales
effort.  Thus, monopolistic competition, although it destroys profits, results
in lower production and higher price than does perfect competition.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            But
these are the very same defects which principles of government ownership, based
on natural monopoly, are designed to overcome.  Since some monopolies are
“inevitable” and since they result in these same defects, they have been held
to be proper items of government ownership. But monopolistic competition is
pictured as being “natural” in the same sense in which “inevitable” monopoly is
so pictured - that is, in [116] the sense that it results from physical facts
which are not subject to determination by policy.  Then the principles which
are based on monopoly’s deviation from the competitive norm would seem
applicable also in the case of monopolistic competition even if the latter does
not result in, nor tend toward, monopoly under a <u>laissez-faire</u> policy.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            The
contemporary complex of economic theory is characterized by the two lines of
development which are outlined here and by various combinations of the three
basic theoretical developments outlined in the previous chapter.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            Both
lines of development in contemporary price theory deviate sharply from the
price theory of value which is the core of the classical general theory.  Both
seek other criteria than price for valuation purposes.  The criterion which is
used in the Keynesian analysis is the level of employment; the criterion which
is implied in the theory of monopolistic competition is the ratio between
production and possible production.  They represent two different approaches to
the central problem of the overall efficiency of the economic process.  But in
each case, reliance on that theory of value necessitates going outside the
theoretical structure for policy determination.  Both reject the general theory
the development of which has provided the tools with which they are
constructed, and neither recognizes the general theory built on the theory of
value which they have adopted.  Both lines of development in contemporary
economic price theory are thus peculiarly [117] orphan.  The have, in effect,
rejected one general theory because of incompatibility, and their place in the
general theory the criterion of which they have adopted is not yet worked out. 
For that reason, perhaps, specific principles concerning the problem of
government ownership based on these two lines of development have not been
formulated.  But both of these developments imply the necessity and possibility
of institutional adjustment and therefore permit the problem of government
ownership to be considered in relation to them.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            In
contemporary economic discussion, the problem of government ownership has
received wide attention.  The proponents and opponents, in each instance in
which the problem has arisen, have felt called-on to give reason for their
positions.  As has been shown the theoretical formulation of opposition to
government ownership in any particular instance, or in general, has been able
to find basis in the classical general theory.  But the proponents of the
government ownership of any particular enterprise, including the classical
theorists, have been forced, in each instance, to base their case on
propositions which are not subject to consideration in terms of the classical
general theory.  And this is true of the contemporary theorists who have
discussed the problem no less than of their predecessors.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            In most
current discussions of the government ownership of any particular enterprise,
the arguments of the proponents generally have run somewhat as outlined by Mr.
Stacey May in [118] the <u>Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences</u>.<a
href="#_ftn220" name="_ftnref220" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[220]</span></span></span></a> 
Those arguments may be listed as follows: (1) that the products of the enterprise
are for government use, (2) that the enterprise is necessary to the economy but
that private capital cannot or will not bring it into being, (3) that the
enterprise should be government-owned in order to conserve natural resources,
(4) that the postponement of returns precludes the enterprise being undertaken
by private firms, (5) that the enterprise is necessary for purposes of military
strategy, (6) that the enterprise will serve as a source of public revenue, (7)
that government ownership of the enterprise is necessary in order to control
the consumption of its product which, if used unrestrainedly, does harm to the
economy, (8) that private motivation in the enterprise is toward cutting costs
which are necessary in order to safeguard the public health, and (9) that the
enterprise is peculiarly ill-adapted to competition in that under competition
it results in inefficient operation.<a href="#_ftn221" name="_ftnref221"
title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[221]</span></span></span></a> </p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            Mr. May
suspects that these arguments are really excuses for collective action, or
reasons offered as sufficient for it, rather than being “in any specific case
actually the efficient causes of the collective action ...”<a href="#_ftn222"
name="_ftnref222" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[222]</span></span></span></a>  He
concludes that [119] “it is not so much theoretical support as evidence of
profitable achievement which led to an ever wider extension of government
activities.”<a href="#_ftn223" name="_ftnref223" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[223]</span></span></span></a>  But in the adjustment of
structural institutions, and unquestionably in those cases which require
specific legal designation, the point of departure is based, at least
ostensibly, on “evidence of profitable achievement.”  In such adjustments,
“sufficient reasons” <u>are</u> the efficient causes at the stage in the
adjustment process at which people must make choices.  In economic theory, all
any reason may ever accomplish is through serving as an efficient cause of
human action.  This, in fact, is seen to be the causally efficient relationship
between the classical general theory and the problem of government ownership. 
In so far as a theory serves as a sufficient reason for making up peoples’
minds on the matter, it serves as an efficient cause in the process of
adjustment.  For it is quite clear that the decisions of people specify the
particular immediate adjustment.  And all human actions which may be
characterized as purposeful can be so only by virtue of the fact that there is
“sufficient reason” to direct the action.  Otherwise, the action cannot be said
to be purposeful - it becomes merely a “random” action.  The “evidence” may be
misconstrued in a “sufficient reason,” but it forms the substance of the reason
and it is given causal effect in institutional adjustments only through
becoming a sufficient reason.  The evidence may be misconstrued, but it [120]
cannot be absent.  So the “sufficient reasons” of which Mr. May speaks are not,
as such, disqualified from serving as efficient causes in determining the
government ownership of any particular enterprise.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            Appreciation
of the fact that the determinants of adjustments in structural institutions
must take effect through the comprehensions of people has been the occasion for
at least one important study of such adjustments in certain economic
enterprises.<a href="#_ftn224" name="_ftnref224" title=""><span

professional scholars collaborated during a period of five years in
investigating the development of various instances of collective enterprise and
published their report in 1943.  Their report includes the pertinent data
pertaining to twenty enterprises which have become, or are becoming, socialized
in the sense that discretionary control over them is vested in groups of people
who do not stand in the relation of private owners investing capital in the
expectation of profits.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            The
investigation was designed and executed to throw light on the “dynamics of
socialization.”<a href="#_ftn225" name="_ftnref225" title=""><span

terms of which the study was set up is that the adjustments under consideration
are made in response to group interests.  And the particular hypothesis which
grew out of [121] preliminary studies and which was to be tested in the
investigation is that the “primary factors in socialization” are “to be found
in the pressure of consumer and general public interests ...”<a href="#_ftn226"

in socialization are thus thought of in terms of human needs and interests and
related group pressures, such as are open to fairly direct observation.  But it
was recognized that identified with and largely shaping these interests are
industrial technology (including means of transportation and communication),
prevailing modes of property, operation of price and market mechanisms,
standards of living , the system of politics, government, and civil liberties,
influences of educational and other social institutions, current mores and
folkways (in addition to those indicated), land and other geographic
conditions, inborn human trains and capacities, and the whole system of
production and distribution with its personnel and capital equipment growing
out of such factors.<a href="#_ftn227" name="_ftnref227" title=""><span

<p class=Body style='margin-left:2.0pt; text-indent:-1.0pt'>            Professor
Seba Eldridge of the University of Kansas, who organized the inquiry, concluded
from the studies and reports on special problems that the factors which act as
“the final and decisive controls of the process” are “consumer and public

Professor Eldridge surmised also that, where consumers and citizens are
comparatively free, this same conclusion is indicated by general observation.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.5in; text-indent:-35.0pt'>              
From the proposition that consumer and citizen choices are comparatively free, </p>

grow </p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.5in; text-indent:-35.0pt'>            in
accordance with their decisions, or what they take to be their interests. 
Consumer-citizens are the <u>selective force</u>, the <u>ultimate control</u>,
in this very important matter.<a href="#_ftn230" name="_ftnref230" title=""><span

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            It
should be noted that the consumer-citizen principle, as stated, neither
contradicts nor supports any of the principles already considered.  All of the
other principles are statements of situations which stimulate recognition, or
force people to recognize, that an enterprise <u>should</u> be
government-owned.  Those principles are conceived as sufficient reasons for
government ownership, and they may serve therefore as causal factors in the
actual determination of government ownership.  If the enterprise in question is
technologically necessary to the physical provision of the means of life and if
the “should” takes the form of the only recognized control arrangement that
will permit the enterprise to be carried on, then government ownership is
without question the answer, regardless of classes or whatever.  In those
instances in which the technological necessity is less clear or in which the
technological possibility [123] of alternative control arrangements is
recognized, the matter becomes a debatable question.  But the outcome of the
debate is the form of ownership specified for the enterprise.  In either
instance, the government ownership of an enterprise becomes “what is” by virtue
of having become recognized as “what ought to be.”  Thus the establishment of
the government ownership of an enterprise points the inescapable connection in
economics between theory and policy and between policy and practice.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            The
consumer-citizen-interests principle, on the other hand, is a statement of
whose minds are made up.  It is phrased in terms which indicate a
presupposition that consumers and citizens determine their interests
differently, in view of the same facts, than do owners, managers, and
laborers.  But since almost all consumers and citizens are either owners or
managers or laborers, and since Professor Eldridge does not intend to say that
an individual’s interests as a consumer-citizen overshadow his particular
interests as an owner or a manager or laborer, it would seem that what the
principle really is saying is that the socialization of an enterprise is in
response to the interests of people outside that particular enterprise.  This
principle’s contribution, in terms of the other principles, seems to be, then,
that the conditions by virtue of which an enterprise can be more efficiently
operated under government ownership are given recognition and effective
expression through people who are not directly engaged in that particular
enterprise.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            The
principles of government ownership may be classified in any number of ways, but
they fall most readily into two [125] general categories.  First, some
principles are statements of situations which specify government ownership
without recourse.  That is to say, they leave no choice in the matter.  When
those conditions prevail, there is no alternative to organizing the enterprise
so that the body politic exercises the functions of ownership.  The other
general category includes the principles which propose to state the conditions
which are sufficient to motivate the shift of an enterprise to government
ownership even though alternative organizations of the enterprise are possible.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            The
conditions which specify government ownership without any possible exception
are all predicated on the supposition that the enterprise in question is

operating on the profit motive, to provide for the initiation and continuation
of the enterprise.</p>

as effective market-demand covers the same idea.  The benefits of things like
education and [126] scientific research, although they return benefits far in
excess of any expenditure on them, and although the actual process of
production cannot be carried forward without them, fall “so insensibly” upon an
individual that he is not motivated in the ordinary market sense.<a

The open market, then, cannot provide such necessaries.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            Alfred
Marshall’s statement of the three conditions under which a necessary enterprise
must be government-owned covers the same ground.<a href="#_ftn234"
name="_ftnref234" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[234]</span></span></span></a>  In
case the supply price is unavoidably above the demand schedule at all points,
it is obvious that private initiative motivated by profit would neither create
nor operate the enterprise.  And in case the supply price is driven above the
demand schedule by risks which can be avoided by the body politic acting
through its government, the same obvious conclusion must be drawn.  Also, there
are cases such as public streets in which Marshall thought that the plain
physical requirement of constant and universal use forbids private ownership
and operation irrespective of the profit possibilities.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            Two
determinants listed by Mr. Stacy May as having wide credence may be placed in
this category.  They are the extreme postponement of returns in a necessary
enterprise and the destruction or depletion of a necessary resource if [127] it
is left to private exploitation.<a href="#_ftn235" name="_ftnref235" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[235]</span></span></span></a> </p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            It
should be noted that each of the eight principles listed in the “necessity”
category is a function of what Veblen called “the state of the industrial
arts.”  It goes without saying that such things as “natural resources” and
things like streets and harbors are instrumental developments and that they are
meaningful by virtue of their function in the process of providing the material
means of life.  Even such things as education can be thought of as “absolutely
necessary” only by virtue of the fact that an illiterate population cannot carry
on the economic process in the current stage of technological development.  In
so far as consideration of government ownership is restricted to “absolutely
necessity,” there can be no doubt that its specification is prescribed by the
state of the industrial arts.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            But it
should be noted also that the prescription, even in the case of “absolute
necessity,” is not automatically transmitted into the specified institutional
structure.  It can be and is so transmitted only through people making up their
minds on the matter.  The import of the “necessity” characterization is that,
in some instances, people can survive and make up their minds on no other basis
than that which is specified by the physical circumstances.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            [128]The
second category of the listed principles may be described as including those
conditions which are thought to serve as “sufficient reason” for making up
peoples’ minds about the ownership of enterprises which are not considered
absolutely necessary or for which alternative control organizations are
possible.  This category may be subdivided in terms of the grounds on which the
determinants serve as sufficient reasons.  The determinants in the second
category are founded on three such bases which are as follows: greater
technological efficiency, protection of the consumer, and social or political
security.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            The
technological-efficiency appeal has been expressed in many ways.  It includes
all of the determinants listed in the first category when applied to
enterprises which are not absolutely necessary in the technological sense.  It
is the content of Senior’s and Jevons’ principles which turn on accomplishing
greater “results”<a href="#_ftn236" name="_ftnref236" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[236]</span></span></span></a> and on effecting “great
advantage and economy.<a href="#_ftn237" name="_ftnref237" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[237]</span></span></span></a>  In the opinion of John
Stuart Mill, it is what is reduced in case a privately owned enterprise must be
organized so that ownership is divorced from its control function and in the
case of an inevitable monopoly.<a href="#_ftn238" name="_ftnref238" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[238]</span></span></span></a> </p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            [129] An
appeal based on protecting the consumer cannot be separated entirely from the
technological-continuity frame of reference.  But it may be used without  any
explicit reference to, or deliberate correspondence with, that basis.  It is in
part what is connoted in Senior’s principle of protecting those who cannot
protect themselves,<a href="#_ftn239" name="_ftnref239" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[239]</span></span></span></a> and it is the basis of the maximization-of-consumer-surplus
principle.<a href="#_ftn240" name="_ftnref240" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[240]</span></span></span></a>  This appeal may be used also
in those cases, such as water supply in which private-profit motivation may
result in harm to the public health.  An appeal of this sort is founded on the
idea of maximizing consumer satisfaction or minimizing disutility.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            The
social-and-political-security appeal usually is framed in reference to military
strategy or to the control of a product which, if left to private initiative,
may result in social and political danger by producing moral turpitude and by
allowing moral turpitude to be expressed in ways which endanger the social and
political certitudes.  This appeal, like the preceding one, cannot be separated
entirely from the technological-efficiency concept.  Indeed, the appellant may
directly correlate the two.  But it likewise may be used with reference to any
other conception of social and political certitude which does not result in
technological impotence.  In the latter case, the ill effects of private
ownership are [130] thought to work out through moral turpitude.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            The
three frames of reference in which the proposed determinants of government
ownership have been thought to be meaningful are technological efficiency,
consumer satisfaction, and moral efficacy.  It has been indicated that the last
two can be defined and stated in terms of the first.  But it should be
emphasized that the converse does not hold true.  Technological efficiency
cannot be stated in any terms other than the scientific evidence in the run of
the facts.  That is why the concept of “necessity,” in the sense of being
unavoidable, is restricted to the technological frame of reference.  And that,
at bottom, is why no “inviolable” principle of government ownership has ever
been framed on any other basis.</p>

Principles and the Run of the Facts</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            The
three frames of reference in terms of which the principles of government
ownership have been proposed are nothing less than the theories of value which
have prevailed in capitalistic history.  They are the concepts which have been
used in identifying economic validity.  As such, they have served as the
guiding principles in making up people’s minds about the matter of government
ownership.  And, as has been observed, the determination of government
ownership for an enterprise in a capitalistic economy requires that a specific
decision be [131] made to that effect - that particular pattern of
control-organization must be chosen for that enterprise.  An inquiry into the
determinants of the government ownership of a particular enterprise should run,
then, in terms of how the conditions of that enterprise enter into making up
people’s minds to that effect.  There are, then, two general aspects of such an
inquiry: (1) the theory of value in terms of which decisions are thought to be
valid, and (2) the situations or conditions which, when considered in those
terms, result in the decision for government ownership.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            The
economic enterprises which are cited in this chapter have become
government-owned at various stages in American history.  Selection in this
regard is deliberate.  Since the present study is concerned with general
pattern in the determination of government ownership in a capitalistic economy,
it is thought best to avoid the exclusive consideration of the process in any
one period.  Accordingly, the examples are cited somewhat in the chronological
order of their determination as government-owned enterprises.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            <u>Streets
and Highways</u>.  The government ownership of streets and highways has long
been a settled matter.  There always have been some privately owned streets and
roads, but they have become such a minor fraction of the total that the phrase
“streets and highways” has come to connote government ownership.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            [132]
From the earliest colonial days in America, the most important streets have
been public operations, but the roads were at first left to private
initiative.  From that beginning, public streets and roads in the United States
have been expanded to approximately 3,425,000 miles representing an investment
of about $20,000,000,000.<a href="#_ftn241" name="_ftnref241" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[241]</span></span></span></a> </p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            These
roadways connect every separately controlled piece of real estate in the United
States.  They are the guarantee of physical entry and exit for every productive
unit of physical property in the nation.  Quite certainly, the economy could
not be carried on without them - they are “absolutely necessary.”</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            It also
is quite certain that any known arrangement for collecting a price directly for
each usage of the roadways would reduce their efficiency.  A full try was made
on that basis.  By 1821, some 4,000 miles of turnpikes capitalized at
$11,000,000 had been built in New York State alone; and by 1832, about 2,400
miles had been built in Pennsylvania.<a href="#_ftn242" name="_ftnref242"
title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[242]</span></span></span></a> 
Subsequently, the states of New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maryland
chartered 705 companies which invested approximately $10,000,000 in toll roads
built of lumber.<a href="#_ftn243" name="_ftnref243" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[243]</span></span></span></a>  Some of these roads were
purely promotional schemes which were designed only [133] to acquire funds by
selling stock, but most of them had some basis in terms of estimated demand and
cost schedules.  They were built where the demand already existed or was
expected immediately in terms of physical traffic.  To have done so would have
required a pay station at every farm and household and shop.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            Also, as
adjoining land was enclosed, and therefore as alternative routes were less and
less available, the payment of tolls came to appear as a direct infringement of
personal freedom of movement.  As such, it violated the common sense and
customs in communities in which the pattern of mores and  folkways had been
fashioned in a frontier environment where movement was free.  The toll gates
became a common object of disapproval at the same time that the roads were
considered a blessing.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            Long
before anything approaching full use of any of the toll roads was attained, and
therefore long before it could be determined if a road actually could possibly
support itself in the open market, public opinion was finding effective
expression, through political action, in specifying public ownership and
operation.  The Constitution of 1789 delegated to the federal government the
“power to establish post-offices and post-roads,”<a href="#_ftn244"
name="_ftnref244" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[244]</span></span></span></a> and
Congress, in the act admitting Ohio to [134] statehood in 1802, specified that
five percent of all receipts from sales of public lands within Ohio be
allocated to the construction of roads.<a href="#_ftn245" name="_ftnref245"
title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[245]</span></span></span></a>  But
the road requirements of the westward movement far exceeded the provision of
funds by such arrangements.  It was perfectly clear even then that the
provision of roads must precede economic development of interior regions, that
to await the development of sufficient traffic to stimulate private provision
of toll roads would be to strangle the economic development of those regions
where waterways did not provide ready-made shipping and trading avenues. 
Without roads, the interior regions of the nation would have to remain on a
locally self-sufficient basis, and the water-route trading centers would be
denied the increased custom.  But “strict construction” of the Constitution
forbade appropriations for “internal improvements”; and even if the money
market would provide the states with funds to construct highways which were not
designed entirely for the exclusive benefit of individual states, the state
government were disinclined toward it.  By 1806, pressure on Congress was
sufficient to secure passage of the first appropriation for a national
highway.  From that year to 1856, the United States Government spent $7,000,000
on the Cumberland Road running from Cumberland, Maryland to Vandalia, Illinois.<a

</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            [135]
The advent of the railroads in the 1830s and their rapid development up to
about 1890 returned the highway question back to the states where the problem
took the form of “getting to the railroad.”  From about 1850 to about 1890, the
road problem was almost altogether restricted to the states.  The problem of
getting to the railroad became an important one, and it began to be considered
more and more on a statewide basis as the railroads approached their final
pattern in the 1880s and 1890s.  New Jersey began a plan of state-aid to local
jurisdictions for road construction in 1891, and Massachusetts assumed
responsibility about ten years later for a state system of primary highways
connecting all parts of the state.<a href="#_ftn247" name="_ftnref247" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[247]</span></span></span></a> </p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            But the
movement for a national network of highways in the modern sense had its
beginning among bicyclists.<a href="#_ftn248" name="_ftnref248" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[248]</span></span></span></a>  The bicycle was, and is, a
good-road vehicle, and by 1900 there were in the neighborhood of 1,000,000
people in the United States who used them as their major means of personal
transportation.  The League of American Wheelmen, which was formed in 1890,
agitated for improved highways through its publications and its membership. 
Other groups were interested as shown by the attendance at the first national
Assembly for Good Roads Promotion in 1902.  In attendance at that conference
were delegates from state good-roads organizations, boards of trade, [136]
farmers’ organizations, agricultural colleges, wheelmen’s leagues, and railway
associations.  The delegates formed the National Good Roads League which held
its first convention the next year in Washington, D. C.  During the same year,
Congress created the Office of Road Inquiry in the Department of Agriculture.<a

</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            The
automobile was entering the scene about the same time. In 1895, there were
fewer than 100 automobiles in America; by 1905, there were 15,000; by 1937,
there were 31,000,000, almost an automobile for every four people in the
nation.<a href="#_ftn250" name="_ftnref250" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span

The entire population could be put on wheels at the same time.  The automobile
was a fact which could be argued with only unsuccessfully.  It forced the
highway question back to national scope, and it even placed considerable
pressure on the independent authority of contiguous nations.  Correlative
decisions had to be made for the several states and, to some degree, for
adjoining nations.  The most obvious way for getting correlation among the
states was through the federal government.  The pressure in that direction
resulted in the federal-aid act of 1916 which, with its subsequent amendments,
looks toward developing the road network of the entire nation into one,
integrated whole through Federal grants-in-aid to the states to assure [137]
development and through qualifying specifications to assure integration,
physical quality, and continued expansion.<a href="#_ftn251" name="_ftnref251"

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            Did
streets and highways become government-owned for reasons which find expression
through the market process?  Quite clearly, the immediate specification in each
case was through people making up their minds that government ownership was the
proper pattern of control organization.  But why did people decide on that
answer?  Was there insufficient private capital?  No, road bonds have always
found a ready market.  Was it that consumers could not pay for the service? 
No, the users of streets and highways have paid and do pay for the service.<a
href="#_ftn252" name="_ftnref252" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[252]</span></span></span></a>  
Were the prospective returns postponed beyond the market vision?  No, the
returns are current throughout the life of the enterprise.  Did divorce between
ownership and control reduce the effective exercise of the ownership motive? 
No, this seems to have had nothing to do with the matter.  Was it to maximize
consumers surplus?  No, the greatest prospective return would seem to be at the
maximum utilization of plant.  Was it to control the use of the product -  to
control traffic?  Clearly not.  The government ownership of streets and roads
seems to have been occasioned by situations which do not find [138] expression
through price.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            First,
roads became a physical necessity and were recognized as such.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            Second,
the market process did not keep up with the recognized need.  The market
failure in this regard evidently was not occasioned by unwillingness or
inability of consumers to pay for the product.  Nor was it a dearth of the
materials and labor and capital funds required in construction and operation. 
In those cases in which the road was built originally under government
ownership, the failure of private initiative was an entrepreneurial, not a
consumer, failure.  This seems to have been, at least in part, the result of
both financial and physical inability to collect for each individual
consumption of the product.  Because of the money-income arrangements of the
economy at large, collection had to be on a different basis than a sale of each
individual act of consumption.  But such an arrangement takes on the character
of a tax, and the people had learned well the results of paying a tax to anyone
not under their selective control.  This was so obvious that the problem was never
mentioned in that connection.  The same set of circumstances spelled the
failure of toll roads even in those cases in which they were successful private
enterprises in the sense that they were profitable.  The physical needs of
roads could be better met by payment through taxes than by sale of the
service.  And, as this became apparent to the community at [139] large,
politicians were not long in using it for political purposes.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            The
general pattern of the institutional adjustments relating to streets and roads
has been in the direction of setting up the control devices which permit the
optimum physical correlation between roads and the remainder of the economy.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            This
pattern of adjustment has not been restricted to the problem of ownership; it
is apparent also in relation to the level of organized efforts to get more and
better roads.  As long as the physical problem was a local one, the policy
problem was restricted to that level; when the physical problem became a
national one, the policy problem shifted to that level.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            In each
instance, the general pattern of the causal sequence seems to have been as
follows: (1) the development of a physical need, (2) recognition of that need
by the people involved, and (3) selection of the most efficient, available control-device. 
The first step was a matter of people and geography and invention.  It was
occasioned in some measure by people pushing beyond the area of the
price-determined economy because of comparatively superior living-getting
possibilities in the relatively non-price frontier-economy.  Thus, price
determinations may be thought of as a causal factor.  But that relationship was
one of restriction and limitation rather than one of positive dynamic.  The
first step bears out the principle of technological determination.  The second
step was a matter of enlightenment.  It bears out the principle of recognized
[140] interdependence.  The third step was a matter of accommodation within the
limits imposed by the first two steps and by those aspects of the total
institutional structure which did not enter the problem as items on which
choices could be made.  For example, the decisions to place roads under
government ownership did not entail any prospect of abandoning payment by the
people who used the roads generally, nor did it involve any idea of the roads
not being paid for in money terms.  Thus the government ownership of roads was
made with minimum dislocation to the institutional structure generally.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            <u>Harbors
and Waterways</u>.  The same general pattern of adjustment which has been seen
in the ownership of streets and roads may be observed in the case of harbors
and waterways.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            Government

generally have been proposed for military-supply reasons.  Work-relief
expenditures on rivers and harbors totaled about $525,000,000 from 1933 to
1941.<a href="#_ftn265" name="_ftnref265" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span

The work-relief motive has not been offered as a reason for government
ownership; rather, it has been the occasion for increasing expenditures on
whatever kinds of projects were established already as government functions.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            But such
extensions, in the case of river developments, brought into public attention
the possibility of correlating the several functions which such developments
might serve.  It was argued that electric power, water and soil conservation,
irrigation, flood control, and recreation could all be accomplished in some
instances by correlating the technical installations so that all these
functions would be mutually supportive.  It was argued further that, since the
optimum correlation of these functions would not be in the interests of private
entrepreneurs, it could be accomplished only through government ownership.  The
arguments against these possibilities under government ownership received their
weakest support under conditions in which the necessity for relief from
unemployment [144] was apparent to everybody. It was under such conditions that
the Tennessee Valley Authority was initiated as an experiment in correlating
the functions which a river system might be made to serve by direct planning
toward that end.</p>

River basin.  For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1943, a surplus of

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            In the
case of waterway developments, it seems that the beneficiaries of the
enterprises are both willing and able to pay for the benefits.  Here, as in the
case of roads, the decisions in favor of government ownership resulted from
conviction that entrepreneurial motivation would not result in those benefits
even though both the ability and willingness to pay were sufficient to meet the
full costs of the enterprise, including the costs of the entrepreneurial
function of organization and direction.  The decisions to organize and direct
the development of waterways under government ownership have not been choices
as to whether or not the product would be paid for.  Rather, they have been
choices between alternative methods of organizing and directing certain
physical processes.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            Those
processes do not lend themselves to ordinary [146] market determination for
several reasons.  First, some functions of waterways cannot be made to bring in
a cash return through sales of the product.<a href="#_ftn272" name="_ftnref272"
title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[272]</span></span></span></a> 
Flood control, water conservation, and soil conservation are examples.  Sales
of none of these can be individualized.  Second, the optimum correlation </p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>of multiple
functions cannot be achieved through direct sales of the product.  Third, the
enterprise sometimes must precede the developments which would permit
reasonable use of plant, and the developmental period may be relatively long.<a
href="#_ftn273" name="_ftnref273" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[273]</span></span></span></a> 
Fourth, the money costs of construction and operation sometimes cannot be
estimated in advance.<a href="#_ftn274" name="_ftnref274" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[274]</span></span></span></a> </p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            Failure
of the entrepreneurial function under private ownership of waterway
developments still leaves the problem of why government was chosen as the
alternative.  The function of government traditionally has been synonymous with
the exercise of the power of mandamus and the power of injunction.  In the
event that either power is involved, government is the most nearly obvious
choice.  And in any case in which the product cannot be withheld from the
individual in order to coerce payment, as in flood control, the direct exercise
of both mandamus and injunction is indicated.  This is particularly [147]
pointed in those instances in which the military factor is important.  In
addition to the power of mandamus and injunction, and partly because of them,
governments have comparatively great financial-investment power.  The taxing
authority alone assures the financial backing of the entire community.  In the
case of a sovereign government, the money-defining authority gives unlimited
power to pay in terms of its legally designated monetary units.  Some waterway
developments have involved very large monetary outlays, larger than any
non-business institution other than government could make available.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            <u>Waterworks
and Sewage Disposal</u>.  Urban communities in the United States require an
average daily supply of about 100 gallons of water <u>per capita</u>.<a
href="#_ftn275" name="_ftnref275" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[275]</span></span></span></a> 
Twenty to 50 gallons of that supply must be satisfactory for home consumption;
and, since the employment of more than one set of water mains is more costly
than purification, the entire supply usually is brought up to the standards of
purity required for direct human consumption.  Quite obviously, anything which
affects the quantity or quality of the water supply immediately becomes a
concern of the utmost importance to the entire community.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            Of equal
importance and concern is the disposal of water after its pollution through use
by the community.  And [148] closely related to the disposal of waste water is
the problem of waste disposal generally.  An increasing proportion of waste
removal has been waterborne.  The earliest sewers were designed for surface
drainage only, but more recent engineering developments have permitted the use
of sewers for the disposal of most wastes which are soluble or which have a
lower density than water and can be reduced to small particles.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            The
earliest waterworks in the United States were privately owned.  Of the
seventeen plants in existence in 1800, only one was constructed under
government ownership, and one of those seventeen plants became government-owned
as late as 1923.<a href="#_ftn276" name="_ftnref276" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[276]</span></span></span></a>  From 1800 to 1939, the
number of waterworks increased from seventeen to 12,760, and the percentage of
those plants which were government owned increased from 5.9 to 73.<a

</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            Sewage-disposal
installations have shown a similar trend except that they were developed later
and have been more nearly altogether government-owned.  The first
comprehensive, water-carriage, sewage-disposal system was started in the City
of Chicago in 1856 after that city’s representatives reported on a study of the
installations in Hamburg, Germany where a similar system had been installed in
1843.<a href="#_ftn278" name="_ftnref278" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[278]</span></span></span></a> 
In 1938, only [149] 7,490 of 16,303 incorporated communities in the United
States had sewage-disposal facilities.  Of this number only 255 were privately
owned.<a href="#_ftn279" name="_ftnref279" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span

</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            The
debate over the form of ownership of waterworks was at its height from about
1875 to shortly after the turn of the century. Private companies fell into
disfavor in part because of higher rates granted in earlier franchises. 
Capitalization of earnings under those rates made it extremely difficult to
regulate prices, and this resulted in continuous controversy and discontent. 
As late as 1932, rates of privately owned firms were from 58.9 percent higher
for 5,000 gallons per month to 20.7 percent for 1,000,000 gallons.<a

</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            Health
and hygienic considerations have given some impetus to the government ownership
of both waterworks and sewage-disposal plants.<a href="#_ftn281"

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[281]</span></span></span></a> 
Public health authorities and private physicians have worked through every
educational means at their disposal to impress upon everybody the importance to
community health of the proper provision and use of water and waste disposal. 
But the explanations offered by the experts have run in terms of prophylaxis
and physiology, not in terms of effective demand and cost schedules.  Medical
experts thus [150] have helped in convincing the community at large that the
comparative need of an item which directly affects the health of the community
is not necessarily reflected in comparative price and that it therefore may not
be elicited through price adjustment.  In addition, it has become increasingly
apparent that the health of the community is endangered by any of its members being
without sanitary facilities.  For this reason, demands for extensions of mains
into the less densely settled areas have found ready support by people who were
not directly affected.  Such extensions discourage private investment by
increasing the ratio between capital investment and returns from sales.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            Savings
in the cost of fire insurance have been a further stimulus toward municipal
ownership.  Water supply has been a heavily weighted factor in the
determination of premium charges.  And the cost of providing the extra capacity
needed for fire protection frequently has been more than offset by savings in
the cost of insurance.<a href="#_ftn282" name="_ftnref282" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[282]</span></span></span></a>  For this reason, persons who
otherwise have had comparatively little interest in a unified waterworks system
have favored it.  But since a comparatively small fraction of the total volume
of water has been consumed in fighting fires, the sales for that purpose by
private firms have represented a comparatively smaller return on the
corresponding capital [151] investment.  As the number of fires is reduced, the
sale of water for that purpose is reduced; but money savings to the community
are thereby increased.  It is not consonant with the interests of a private
owner to make capital investments for the purpose of reducing income from
sales.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            After
the development of modern plumbing and sewers and after the discovery of the
bacterial origin of many common diseases, it was no longer a question of
whether the character of the services should be left to the discretion and
efforts of each individual; the only question was what control device was to be
used to bring into existence and to operate the physical plants which were
themselves specified by the scientific “know-how” of the community.  In
settling that question, in regard to waterworks and sewage disposal, the
conjuncture of circumstances in most instances has ruled in favor of government
ownership.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            It
should be noted that there has been no dearth of private capital for investment
in waterworks and in sewage-disposal plants.  Bonds for these plants have had a
ready market.  Also, there has been no indication of inability or unwillingness
of communities to pay for the services.  The inclusive difference here, as in
the case of waterways and in the case of roadways, has been that the private-business
organizational pattern has provided no way in which the ability to pay could be
exploited without contravening the community’s conception of the proper
physical operation of the enterprise.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            [152] <u>Schools</u>. 
In 1647, the Massachusetts colony passed a law requiring all towns of fifty or
more families to establish common schools because “one chief point of that old
deluder, Satan, (is) to keep men from a knowledge of the Scriptures.:<a

Those schools were placed under civil authority but since civil government was
in fact a function of the church, the schools were parochial in character.  The
religious motive remained the dominant influence, though a declining one, until
after the beginning of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            Many
civil leaders in the later colonial and early national period were aware of the
social and economic significance of organized education.  Benjamin Franklin
established the American Academy about 1750.  Men like Jefferson, Washington,
Noah Webster, Rush, Coram, and du Pont gave the problem extended consideration.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>The general public
was not actively concerned.  The ordinary concerns of the average man could be
carried on with very few [153] of the knowledges and skills taught in most of
the common and Latin grammar schools.  Almost all curricula were designed with
a view to preparation for classical college studies, and the run of the daily
life of the ordinary man offered him very little evidence that such studies
could be of much value in relation to those things with which the conjuncture
of circumstances forced him to be concerned.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            That
conjuncture of circumstances was radically changed during the period from about
1800 to 1860.  And that was the period during which government ownership of
schools was established.  The period was one of rapid development in industry
and trade and therefore in urbanization.  Such developments as railroads and highways
and the telegraph accelerated the westward movement and permitted almost
immediate incorporation of newly settled areas into the national economy.
Immigration, mostly from non-English speaking countries, more than offset
westward emigration from the cities, and it infiltered into the new areas. 
Within the period of one man’s memory, the nation expanded across the continent
and became a single, interdependent economy.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            The new
physical circumstances placed heavier penalties on illiteracy.  Active participation
in increasing areas of the economic process became more and more dependent on
ability to use the conceptual tools which comprised part of academic
curricula.  Also, the process of parent-to-child instruction in the use of
conceptual tools broke down almost completely in [154] the urban situation in
which the production unit was no longer family-operated.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            The
changed circumstances also brought on a new pattern of citizenship.  Men who
had never been permitted to vote in the old circumstances found themselves
members of governing bodies and therefore responsible for formulating and
stating social policy in the new communities.  Frontier settlements offered new
social, political, and economic ambition to many who had been part-citizens in
the older communities.  The old states tried to hold their people by broadening
the franchise, and thus manhood suffrage became fairly universal except in the
slave-holding areas.  Final responsibility for deciding questions of public
policy was thus shifted more and more to the underlying population.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            The need
of organized education was there, and the people who were not receiving it were
in a position to give effective expression to their need.  But the first
demands for universal schooling did not come from those people; they came
mostly from educated persons who were, in effect, demanding that the untutored
poor be taught good manners.<a href="#_ftn285" name="_ftnref285" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[285]</span></span></span></a>   Precautions were taken to
assure that the conceptual tools, such as language and mathematics, were used
toward that end.  The poor were not enthusiastic; they resisted by not
cooperating.  And it was not [155] until the need of skill in the use of the
conceptual tools which were incorporated in school curricula for other purposes
- it was not until these skills became physically imperative that the general
public actively demanded free, universal schooling.  When that demand came in
the thirties, forties, and fifties of the nineteenth century, political support
by the educated portion of the population already had been assured for quite
different reasons.  Thus, universal schooling came to be very generally
approved by all groups.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            The
demand for universal education through schools could become effective only
through political channels.  Effective demand, in the market sense, was being
satisfied, as always, by private sales; and various institutions other than
government had been trying to meet the problem for two centuries.<a

Government support of popular education first took the form of financial aid to
other, nonprofit institutions.  But where there were numerous organizations,
such as various religious denominations, asking for aid, the system caused
political difficulties.  For example, an interdenominational controversy which
developed in New York City prompted the state legislature to stop the fight in
1842 by creating the City Board of Education and by forbidding appropriations
to any religious sect.<a href="#_ftn287" name="_ftnref287" title=""><span

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            [156]
Development of the American free public school system has been devious and
intermittent.  The pauper-school idea was the conception of the earliest free
schools, and it continued to be associated with public schools in some of the
states until about 1870.  For example, public schools could charge tuition for
children of all but indigent families in Pennsylvania until 1834, and in New
Jersey until 1871.<a href="#_ftn288" name="_ftnref288" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

educational opportunity from ability to pay is still going on.  Such
adjustments as free text books and free immunization against certain diseases
have become fairly general.  Free dental care, eye examinations and
corrections, and even lunches are furnished by many public schools to children
of indigent families; and some schools have made these items a matter of
individual choice.  Also, free educational opportunity still is being extended
to higher levels of study.  Many public school districts operate free junior
colleges, and some districts have established standard colleges and
universities which are partly supported from school district tax funds.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            Schools
for the people at large are uniquely modern.  Before the modern machine
technology came into general use, there was no time in history in which the
social and economic process could not be carried on without organized training
of [157] the whole population in the use of conceptual tools.  Schools for the
military arts and for special ceremonial functions have an ancient lineage. 
And in those schools were developed many of the conceptual tools of language
and mathematics which serve the modern organization of life.  But they could be
restricted to a fraction of the population because the matters with which the
ordinary man was concerned could be carried on without them.  Indeed, in so far
as academic learning served as a basis of invidious distinction, it was more
effective when restricted to as few as possible.  In contrast, the development
of democratic processes and modern technology require universal schooling on
quite different grounds.  Those grounds are the continuation of the productive
process.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            As the
modern physical organization of the economy took shape, there were increasing
compulsions on the individual and on the community to arrange for increased
literacy.  Those compulsions were irrespective of decorous behavior or good
manners or a fear of untutored masses.  They could not be avoided by the
attainment of all those virtues on the part of the underlying population and
therefore by the alleviation of fear on the part of the overlying population. 
Regardless of seemly decorum on the part of the masses and placid confidence on
the part of the overlying population, compulsion toward increasing literacy
would have remained a palpable fact.  The heritage of private schools was in
promoting decorum, and they were unfitted by that heritage to meet the problem
of educating [158] an entire people for instrumental reasons.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            In the
case of public schools, as in the previous examples, an essential enterprise
was determined by the community on grounds which had no bearings in market
price.  Here, again, the pattern of income distribution made it impossible to
create and to operate the required enterprise through the open market because
effective demand in the open market did not correspond to the instrumental need
as understood by the community.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            Among
all of the structural institutions which were available for the purpose, other
than the open market, government was the only one which performed the function
of organizing and operating the enterprise with tolerable physical success. 
There seem to have been several reasons for this.  In deliberately striving for
universal literacy, some direct applications of the power of mandamus and the
power of injunction were involved.  School techniques were manifestly
unpalpable to many pupils, and some parents were inclined or compelled by
circumstances of poverty to use their children for money-earning purposes, and
this conflicted with scholastic schedules.  In either case, alternative
corrective measures were not known to the science of education and they were
not within the community's pattern of recognized interdependence, and so legal
compulsions were used.  Also, the required financial outlays were greater than
the resources of any non-business institution, other than government, in most
local communities.  A further circumstance was the fact that government was the
only institution which [159] included all of the people.  Where several
institutions with divergent ends in view tried to handle the problem, partisan
controversy over the character of the enterprise was the inevitable result. 
This was not eliminated by government ownership, but that pattern of control
did leave school affairs more nearly open to the entire community and more
responsible to community opinion.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            <u>Forestry</u>. 
From time to time since early colonial days in America, some public concern has
arisen in relation to forest resources.  In 1626, Plymouth Colony passed an
ordinance restricting timber exports.<a href="#_ftn289" name="_ftnref289"
title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[289]</span></span></span></a>  The
immediately local supply was of great importance as the source of fuel and
building material since heavy transportation was restricted to waterways.  On
several occasions during the colonial period and during the first century of
national life, efforts were made to control exploitation of the nation’s
forests.<a href="#_ftn290" name="_ftnref290" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[290]</span></span></span></a>  But the present policy of
government ownership and operation of reserve timber supply did not begin to
take shape until the last decade of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            At that
time, the American economy was beginning to feel the effects of the
disappearance of the frontier.  During the first century and quarter of
America’s national history, [160] one of the most important factors in her
economic life was the presence of seemingly unlimited and easily attained
natural resources.  Unexploited land had been a major factor during 150 years
of colonial experience, and it remained a part of the picture more than a
century after the attainment of political independence.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            On the
frontier, the manner of life was very different from that in the more settled
areas.  The family unit was almost a complete economy.  The frontiersman was
his own blacksmith, carpenter, tanner, planter, weaver, baker, candlestick
maker, and even his own army.  His development of such an array of arts was not
in the pattern of his inheritance.  Here was a new way of life, and it brought
forth new attitudes and a new demeanor - it created the frontiersman as a
type.  His range of honesties was different; his attitude toward authority was
different; his concepts of fair practice were different; his hospitality was
different; even his language became different.  There was no mistaking a
frontiersman when he came to town - he was obviously a frontiersman - and yet
the most obvious thing about him was that he was different from every other
frontiersman and very different from the people in the old settled
communities.  It may be said that a common characteristic of frontiersmen was
their belief in a man’s right to be different.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            This
type of man was selected by the run of circumstances to lead America’s
expansion to the west.  His concepts set the pattern in each new-settled area. 
He had to change his techniques [161] as he passed from one type of unsettled
region to another,<a href="#_ftn291" name="_ftnref291" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[291]</span></span></span></a> but there was always the
“golden opportunity” offered by free resources until the land of America came
under private ownership.  When T. E. C. Leslie wrote, in 1888, that American
conditions lend themselves well to the idea that there is beneficence in the
arrangements of the economic world,<a href="#_ftn292" name="_ftnref292" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[292]</span></span></span></a> he was looking at the
incomparable development of America during the period when the application of
the new technology to comparatively free resources permitted the United States
to absorb most of Europe’s “surplus” production.  This is witnessed by the fact
that the United States entered the twentieth century the greatest debtor nation
in the world.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            But the
disappearance of the frontier changed all of this.  It brought about a reversal
of the government’s policy of giving land subsidies to railroads; it prompted
attention to humus conservation; it stimulated consideration of the effects of
land use on the hydrologic cycle.  In short, it brought into focus the
necessity of land-use planning.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            The
frontier heritage of free-use continued to influence national land policy.  The
West continued to elect congressmen who favored rapid exploitation of timber
resources.  In 1880, [162] almost all conservation votes in Congress came from
New England and from east of the Mississippi and north of the Ohio.<a

By 1891, a general revision of the public land laws was widely advocated, and
an omnibus bill for that purpose was passed by Congress.  In the closing days
of the session, a Forest Reserve Section was attached in a rather devious
manner while the bill was in joint committee.<a href="#_ftn294"
name="_ftnref294" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[294]</span></span></span></a>  The
bill passed without extended debate the day before adjournment; but when
President Harrison, within a few days, exercised the power to establish timber
reserves by proclaiming the Yellowstone National Park Reserve, there was
vigorous objection.  However, the policy stood, and President Harrison added
about 13,000,000 acres to the national forest reserve.<a href="#_ftn295"
name="_ftnref295" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[295]</span></span></span></a>  When
President Cleveland set aside an additional 21,000,000 acres in 1897 on the
recommendation of the National Academy of Sciences, “a storm broke loose in
Congress.”<a href="#_ftn296" name="_ftnref296" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[296]</span></span></span></a>  However, in the debate which
followed, a bill was fashioned and passed giving the Secretary of the Interior
the power to sell timber and to “make provision for the protection of the
reserves.”<a href="#_ftn297" name="_ftnref297" title=""><span

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            Thus the
federal government went into the business of [163] growing timber and selling
the product.  Under the leadership of Gifford Pinchot the Forest Service
established its reputation as a model of administrative efficiency, and after
being transferred to the Department of Agriculture in 1905 developed the
permanent policy of managing the public forests to provide a sustained yield by
selling the mature trees and tending the immature one.<a href="#_ftn298"

1911, the policy was extended to buying up and reforesting denuded land in the
Appalachian and White Mountains areas.  By 1940 there were 227,536,705 acres
within national-forest boundaries, and of that area 176,567,095 acres were
being managed on the basis of sustained yield.<a href="#_ftn299"

that year, the Forest Service was allocated $76,404,234 including $32,929,351
for work relief; and during the same fiscal year, sales amounted to
$5,859,183.87.<a href="#_ftn300" name="_ftnref300" title=""><span

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            The
physical interconnections between forests and the remainder of the economy are
not confined to the provision of timber.  Forests protect watersheds from rapid
soil erosion and thus prevent silting of stream beds and waterways.  By
reducing the rapidity of runoff in periods of heavy precipitation, they
increase water flow in periods of drought.  These factors are important to
waterway development for transportation, power, flood control, and irrigation;
but watershed protection cannot [164] be sold in the open market.   The owner
of a forested watershed cannot exact payment from downstream property owners
for maintaining his forests and thus rendering them important services.  On the
other hand, he can strip the watershed of timber and thus cause those same
owners to incur damages.  The open market has no device by which the culture
and sale of timber can be brought into rapport with other aspects of the
economy which depend on it in considerable measure.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            This
basic disrapport comes into sharper focus when it is remembered that the long
growing period of most trees forces the commercial operator to consider timber
much as the mine owner thinks of coal - private owners most generally “mine”
timber.<a href="#_ftn301" name="_ftnref301" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span

To cultivate a crop of Douglas fir until maturity would require entrepreneurial
anticipations to extend over about eighteen or twenty generations, and the
anticipated price would have to be astronomical.  Manifestly, entrepreneurs
cannot operate in such terms.  In most cases, the profit motive is best served
by stripping the marketable timber in the least expensive manner and diverting
the land to alternative employments.  In many instances, no marketable
alternative is available, and so [165] the land is left unused.<a
href="#_ftn302" name="_ftnref302" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span

</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            The
national forest policy was developed under strong protest from very powerful
financial interests.<a href="#_ftn303" name="_ftnref303" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[303]</span></span></span></a>  Both “producers” and
“consumers” of the commodity objected to nationalization of the forests.  Nor
did support for the policy come from people who had any peculiar relationship
to the industry as consumers of lumber or timber.  Conservation of forests was
favored most strongly in the northeastern states, but there is no reason for
thinking that the East was more dependent on the conservation of forests than
was the West.  And there is no evidence that any profit-motive enterprise in
the East was to be given a peculiar advantage, as compared with any other
section, by planning for continued supplies of timber and for the other
advantages which were claimed for the policy.  In fact, the immediate pecuniary
interests and consumer interests of all these groups would cause them to oppose
both conservation and planned correlation.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            Leadership
in the movement was furnished by men who had studied the problem from the
standpoint of continued material benefit to the entire economy.  Some of them
spent their personal wealth in furthering the movement,<a href="#_ftn304"
name="_ftnref304" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[304]</span></span></span></a> and
there is no evidence [166] that personal gain could accrue to any of them
through adoption of the policy they advocated.  The simple fact is that their
arguments were more readily understood in the areas where the results of
free-enterprise operations in the timber business were more nearly apparent. 
People in the eastern states had witnessed the aftereffects of unplanned timber
exploitation.  They had seen sawmill towns come and go; they had seen floods
rush out of the hills; they had seen almost bare-rock watersheds where topsoil
once supported thick stands of timber; they had seen clear streams turn into
muddy swamps; and they had seen mud flats where river boats once had landed. 
Those people were not so difficult to convince that unplanned individual
exploitation of timber resources did not increase the real wealth of the
nation.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            The
policy whereby the government owns and operates more than 200,000,000 acres of
forest land cannot be explained in terms of private gain or consumer
interests.  And it cannot be explained by a failure of private initiative to
supply the market demand for forest products.<a href="#_ftn305"
name="_ftnref305" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[305]</span></span></span></a>  It
seems to have come about through conviction that the industry must be planned
directly in reference to the physical needs of the economy on a national
scale.  That conviction was the result of evidence [167] that the forces of the
market impelled private owners of timber land to act in a manner which
precluded optimum physical correlation between the provision of timber and the
remainder of the economy.  Such things as continuation of the supply of timber
and other forest products, the conservation of water and soil, flood control,
irrigation, the protection of waterways and power sites, the preservation of
wild game, and the provision of recreational facilities were recognizably
connected with the management of timber lands.  But all of those recognized
needs not only were not implemented by private management of timber land, they
were obstructed by such management.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            The
federal government was the only control device which could give promise of
achieving the necessary correlations.  Since the government already had vast
areas of timber land in its possession, the minimum dislocation obviously was
merely not to dispose of some of those holdings.</p>

almost a century, the limited-dividend idea and legislation against bad housing
were the only devices countenanced in efforts to solve the housing problem. 
Whatever housing reforms were accomplished had to include arrangements for
rents which would at least equal full cost.  Measures within that limitation
accomplished some results, but the slums continued to grow.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            The New
York State Housing Act of 1926 provided for city and state tax exemption of
limited-dividend housing companies.  Several companies, including three

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            Another
attack on the problem was to arrange for government aid to business interests
in the real-estate field in order to reduce capital costs.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            [169] In
1932, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation was authorized to make loans </p>

Its immediate purpose was to protect local building and loan associations and
other lending institutions from bankruptcy.  The Board was empowered to make
loans to local firms which could offer real-estate mortgages as security.  But
public confidence in local saving-and-loan associations was not restored until
two years later when the Board was given authority to insure individual
deposits up to $5,000.  This was accomplished through the creation of a
subsidiary, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation.  But the most
important government aid to the private financing of residential construction
has been the insurance of mortgage loans through the Federal Housing Administration.<a

The services offered by these agencies have enabled them to influence interest
rates, terms of payment, design of building, and neighborhood planning.  They
generally are credited with bringing housing within reach of the lower
middle-income brackets and with raising the standards of residential
construction.  Also, it has been expected that by raising the standards of
construction and increasing the convenience of purchase and by reducing capital
costs the supply of standard dwellings would be increased and thus cause a
movement away from the slums.  But the slums have continued to grow.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            For more
than a century, there has been a constantly increasing realization that the
existence of slums imposes inescapable penalties on the entire economy.  That
realization has been augmented as the relevant data have been collected and
brought into view.  But it never has reached the point in public comprehension
which would stimulate direct corrective action.  The first specific provision
for the physical destruction of slums had to await the convergence of the
problem itself with another problematic situation which did arouse direct
action.  The other problematic situation was severe, continued, and widespread
depression.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            In the
depression of the 1930s, the American people demanded corrective action. 
During the first three years of that period, corrective measures were
restricted largely to making available capital funds and to raising the
propensity to consume.  The former was the intention of such agencies as [171]
RFC, FHLBB, and FLB; the latter was attempted through personal appeals by
lenders and through advertising campaigns.  Both kinds of efforts were
continued after a change of administrations in 1933; but, in addition, a policy
of direct relief and public works was inaugurated.  The National Industrial
Recovery Act of 1933 included a minor clause which permitted the construction
of low-rent and slum-clearance projects out of the appropriation for public
works.<a href="#_ftn315" name="_ftnref315" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[315]</span></span></span></a> 
The pressure of the general emergency and the fractional character of the
housing provision were circumstances which favored a minimum of objection to
the prospect of public housing as it was prescribed in the bill.  Congress
displayed very little interest in the housing clause, and it was enacted as
part of the general bill for industrial recovery.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            The
Housing Division of the Public Works Administration set about solving the legal
and technical problems involved in the inauguration of public housing as a
slum-clearance and an employment-generating enterprise.  Court decisions
holding that PWA could not condemn land for public housing forced the agency to
ask for state legislation creating local public-housing authorities which could
condemn land for such purposes.<a href="#_ftn316" name="_ftnref316" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

continued its activities until 1937 when it was replaced by the United States
Housing Authority.  At that [172] time, $134,000,000 had been spent on 51
projects in 36 cities and on two projects in insular possessions.<a

</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            The USHA
was authorized under the 1937 act to give financial and technical assistance to
local housing authorities.<a href="#_ftn318" name="_ftnref318" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[318]</span></span></span></a>  The authority could make
loans up to 90 percent of total project cost, but all such loans must be repaid
with interest.  One condition of such loans was that the local authorities must
arrange for slum clearance which would equal the housing capacity of the
projects.  Another condition was that the local “subsidy,” either through tax
exemption or cash payment to the local authority, must be at least twenty
percent of the USHA annual grants in aid which may be as high as 3.5 percent of
total construction cost but which usually approximately cover interest on
capital investment.  Since aggregate rents for each project must cover
operating costs including replacements, maintenance, and repair, the federal subsidy
is in effect a government guarantee that interest on all bonds will be paid. 
And, to the extent that the federal government holds the bonds, the federal
subsidy is, in effect, the government paying itself interest.  The local and
federal “subsidies” have reduced the necessary rents to operating costs plus
perpetual maintenance.  On this basis, the average monthly rent in 1941 was
$12.79 per [173] family dwelling unit.<a href="#_ftn319" name="_ftnref319"
title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[319]</span></span></span></a>  By
establishing rental schedules on the basis of family income, most local authorities
have been able to accept some very low-income tenants.  At the end of 1940,
seventeen percent of all tenant families in USHA projects had incomes under
$600 per year, and 44 percent had yearly incomes under $900.  Only seven
percent were receiving as much as $100 per month.<a href="#_ftn320"

February of 1942, the USHA, together with other government agencies engaged in
the construction of housing, was incorporated into the Federal Public Housing
Authority which now administers almost all government-owned housing.  In the
low-rent, slum-clearance program, the FPHA is continuing the USHA pattern
essentially unchanged.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            The
policy of the FPHA is to avoid all competition with private investment in the
construction of housing.  No family is accepted as a tenant if its income
permits buying or renting adequate housing in the open market, and continued
occupancy is dependent on the same condition.  Thus publicly owned housing in
the United States is intended to provide adequate housing for people who are
unable to secure it in the open market.  Up to 1941, public-housing provided
for about 190,000 families.<a href="#_ftn321" name="_ftnref321" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[321]</span></span></span></a>  But estimates of the number
of [174] families for whom the open market could not provide adequate housing
vary from six to seven million.<a href="#_ftn322" name="_ftnref322" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[322]</span></span></span></a>  Obviously, if slums are to
be destroyed, or even arrested, through public housing, the effort will have to
be greatly expanded.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            Public
housing, like public forestry, was initiated as a minor phase of a more
inclusive program.  Gradually, the general public had become convinced that the
open market did not arrange the housing situation in the best interest of the
community.  For a century, studies of the problem had accumulated evidence that
there were inescapable connections between inadequate residential facilities
and the general welfare of the entire community, including the well-housed. 
Certain connections, in the sense of consequence, became fairly evident through
such things as disease, crime, and fire hazards; but the causal antecedents of
the situation obviously were very complex, so complex that students of the
problem, even yet, hardly have begun to attain a systematic analysis. 
Complexity forced the analysis to the level of general community planning.  And
when planning for the general level of employment was engendered by economic
depression, housing had become acceptable as a phase of that planning.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            Here,
again, the community at large was convinced by the run of the facts that the
open market in housing interfered with the economic and social process.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            [175]
Housing differs from the preceding examples in that the government-owned item
is for the exclusive use of an individual person or family.  Community
ownership of items which are used by the entire community is not a rarity in
capitalistic economies, but housing is perhaps the only instance in which a
privately consumed item is government-owned during its consumption.  This
dispels the hypothesis that an enterprise must be one of public use in order to
qualify for ownership by a democratically organized government.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            The
failure of the private provision of housing for low-income families has not
been a failure in the sense that the enterprise could not be operated at a
profit.  On the contrary, the very poorest housing often has given the highest
rate of net returns on capital investment.  The failure has been, rather, that
the character of the product under private ownership has not permitted the
enterprise to perform its function efficiently in the instrumental sense.  The
judgment of failure has rested on non-price evidences entirely.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            Government
ownership of low-rent dwellings seemed to be unavoidable if the problem was to
be solved at all.  To acquire the necessary land and to destroy slum dwellings
required direct exercise of the power of mandamus and injunction.  Also, the
financial requirements exceeded the resources of any non-government institution
other than business enterprise.<a href="#_ftn323" name="_ftnref323" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[323]</span></span></span></a> </p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            [176] It
should be pointed out that the initiation of public housing, like that of the
previous examples, was accomplished with minimal institutional adjustments. 
The effort of federal agencies to exercise the right of eminent domain for
low-rent housing was thwarted in the courts with the result that local
jurisdictions were created by state legislation with authority to own the housing
projects.  Federal financing was arranged in the form of loans to the local
authorities.  Thus federal-government financing was combined with
local-government ownership without disturbing the current pattern of legal
authority.  Bookkeeping transactions were devised whereby federal “subsidies”
to meet the interest on local-authority bonds held by the federal government
were paid to the local authority and then repaid to the federal government. 
The propriety of bonds bearing interest thus was not infringed.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            No one
of the principles or combination of the principles of government ownership
which have been proposed in economic literature is common to all of the
examples cited in this study.  For example, there is no reason to think that
forestry and [177] housing were tending toward monopoly when they were
established as government-owned enterprises.  For another example, inability of
private owners to make a profit because of the relation between cost and demand
schedules under private ownership certainly does not apply to waterworks,
forestry and housing; and it is not altogether certain that it applies to
schools or even to highways.  Also, there is no evidence in any example that
private enterprise has lacked the required capital funds.  Such factors as
universal use, conservation of natural resources, extreme postponement of
returns, and military strategy have played parts in particular cases, but none
of them has been common to the whole sample.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            Quite
clearly, the economic enterprises which have become government-owned in the
United States cannot be characterized in terms of a particular type of physical
process or equipment or organizational structure; and they cannot be explained
in terms of rates of profit or loss to private owners or by ratios between
operating and capital costs or by a dearth of private capital funds.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            If the
phenomenon, as a category, is to be explained at all, it must be regarded in
terms of its interconnections with the whole of the economic process.  The
least inclusive and most specific level of generalization which makes the run
of the facts in each instance must comprehend the determination of purposeful
choices which are made by the community.  At that level of generalization,
pattern becomes apparent.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            [178]
First, a problematic situation arises in relation to an economic enterprise. 
What constitutes the problematic situation in each instance is divergence
between the possible contributions of the enterprise to the general economic
process and the actual performance in that regard under non-government
ownership; what occasions the problematic character of the situation is a
change in the physical circumstances relating to the enterprise on the one hand
and the concurrent maintenance of existing control arrangements on the other. 
In other words, a problematic situation is occasioned by a failure to adjust
the control mechanism in correlation with other aspects of the enterprise. 
This is tantamount to saying that if the control problems relating to an
economic enterprise are to be resolved at all, the answers must be in terms of
instrumental efficiency.  Second, government ownership of the enterprise in
question becomes recognized as a possible alternative control device.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            The
compulsions of the problematic situation stimulate general public concern about
proper control arrangements for the enterprise.  As the compulsions bear more
heavily and as public concern and consideration increase accordingly,
alternative control arrangements are proposed.  In some instances, for example
schools and low-rent housing, several alternative control devices are tried. 
But as long as disrapport between physical possibility and actual performance
continue to stimulate public consideration, further alternatives are brought
into view.  Government always has been among the available [179] alternatives;
and when the public comprehension of the problem settles on government as the
most desirable control device, arrangements to that effect are brought about
through political action.<a href="#_ftn324" name="_ftnref324" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            There is
a third factor which is common to all the examples cited in the present study
and which is borne out by general observation.  In establishing government
ownership of an enterprise, institutional adjustments are held to the minimum. 
In no instance do the adjustments exceed those which are necessary in order to
resolve the problematic situation.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            The
conclusions to be drawn from the present study are simple, and they are fairly
obvious in view of what has been presented in the preceding chapters.  Some of
them are implicit in the context of their presentation, and some of them have
been explicitly stated.  At this point, it is convenient to present them in the
order of their emergence in the study proper.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body align=center style='margin-left:1.0pt;text-align:center'>The
Classical Theory as the Basis of Analysis</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            It has
been shown that the classical general theory offers no basis for a
consideration of government ownership in a capitalistic economy.  And so it is
that, although the major spokesmen for the classical general theory always have
favored the government ownership of some economic enterprise, they have been
forced to go outside their general theory in order to explain their position on
that matter.  This is not accidental.  A central content of the classical
general theory, from its first inclusive statement in <u>The Wealth of Nations</u>
to its last reformulation in Marshall’s <u>Principles</u>, is that the only way
in which the real and basic economic factors can be judged is [181] through the
adjustment of price in a free and open market.  Then the circumstance that the
spokesmen for the general theory have been forced to found their explanation of
government ownership outside of the price structure means more than just an
excursion in search of extended evidence.  In fact, it is a disavowal of the
central content of that general theory by its foremost spokesmen.  For it is
quite clear that to plan the creation and operation of an economic enterprise
under government ownership requires the assumption that there are other ways
than free-market price in which the basic economic factors can be judged.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            A
corollary of the dictum that free-market price is the only way in which the
basic economic factors can be judged is the dictum that the free market is the
only structural institution which permits the logical administration of an
economic enterprise.  This is necessarily the case since administration is
nothing more than the making of judgments which determine organization and
operation.  Thus the assumption of a particular structural institution is
germane to the classical general theory.  Here again the classical theorists
have had tacitly to disavow their general theory in order to find any warrant
whatever for the government ownership of any economic enterprise.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            Each
example of government ownership cited in the present study is an instance in
which the community, including almost all economists, decided that the price
theory of valuation [182] did not hold and that there were alternative
structural institutions which could be used to give effect to the decision. 
The decision in each instance was made in reference to the instrumental
functions of the enterprise and to the comparative efficiency of structural
institutions as alternative control devices.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            The
classical general theory not only furnishes no basis for solving the problem of
government ownership, but also denies the possibility of logical consideration
of the problem.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body align=center style='margin-left:1.0pt;text-align:center'>The
Underconsumption Theory as the Basis of Analysis</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            The
underconsumption theory is an analysis of the internal workings of the market
process.  Its claim to generality was deleted by the Keynesian development in
which the basic economic forces are found not to correspond with the pecuniary
accountancy.  In the Keynesian analysis, as well as in the underconsumption
theory proper, the open-market process is found to be defective in that it
cannot provide sufficient effective demand to maintain full employment of the
factors of production.  The theory further indicates that effective market
demand,except under “novel circumstances,” is a constantly decreasing factor. 
Then it follows that since the free-market process cannot, alone, maintain the
requisites of its own continuance, [183] deliberate measures must be taken to
correct the deficiency if the economic process is to continue.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            Government
is the only modern structural institution with the financial resources required
to correct that deficiency. Government is also the only modern structural
institution the control of which is, to any considerable, degree, in the hands
of the people upon whom the incidence of unemployment falls most heavily.  It
is therefore to be expected that at least some measures to relieve unemployment
would be taken through government,</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            Most
government measures for this purpose have taken the form of direct relief to
unemployed persons and increased expenditure on public works.  Generally, the
public works have been those which were already recognized as government
functions; but when the requirements for increased expenditure have pressed heavily
on the outlets already established, new government-owned enterprises have been
instituted.  Public housing and some aspects of waterway development were begun
under such circumstances.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            The
Underconsumption analysis does not explain how or why economic enterprises
become government-owned.  But it does explain the circumstances under which
resistance to the government ownership of an economic enterprise is minimal.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body align=center style='margin-left:1.0pt;text-align:center'>The
Institutionalist Theory as the Basis of Analysis</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            Alternative
to the classical theory, the only non-revolutionary economic analysis which
still can claim generality is the institutionalist theory.  It is the only such
theory which purports to set forth the inclusive and continuing factors in the
economic process.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            It has
been pointed out that the institutionalist theory contains two principles which
may be applied to the problem of government ownership in a capitalistic
economy.  The principle of technological determination is simply that economic
problems can be solved only by adjusting the institutional structures involved
in the problems so as to bring them into instrumentally efficient correlation
with the technological aspects of the problems.  The principle of recognized
interdependence is that the pattern of interdependence which is recognized by
the persons whose actions are correlated in a structural institution specifies
the character of any adjustments in the institutions.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            The run
of the facts in the determination of government ownership in the examples cited
in the preceding chapter conforms with these two principle.  In fact, the
pattern of adjustment which is seen to be common to all of the examples is
almost identical, even in statement, with these principles.  The evidence here
is unexceptionally in support of the institutionalist general theory.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            A third
element has been observed in each instance of [185] a shift of government
ownership.  In all cases the institutional adjustments have been minimal in
both degree and number.  Adjustments which are necessary to the solution of the
instrumental problem in view are the only ones which have been made. 
Adjustments which might increase the efficiency of the operation under
government but which do not necessarily enter the case as a problematic factor
have been avoided.  If the evidence of further inquiries supports the same
observation, a third general principle may be indicated.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body align=center style='margin-left:1.0pt;text-align:center'>Pattern
and Process</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            The
present study originated as an effort to find the determinants of government
ownership in a capitalist economy and to use the pattern of those determinants
as a referential check for general economic theories.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            The
determinants of government ownership display pattern only in the sense of
process or sequence.  They display no pattern in the sense of a particular
arrangement of incidental circumstances or characteristic s which are common to
all government-owned enterprises.  Such circumstances vary from enterprise to
enterprise and are observable in none-government-owned enterprises.  The
pattern of adjustment can be explained only in terms of the process of
adjustment.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0pt; '>            The
process of adjustment in the examples considered in the present study conform
to the institutionalist theory which is itself a general theory of the economy
as a process.</p>
