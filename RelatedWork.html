<p class="about">These three entries are not in Foster’s words. The two syllabi were written at the
University of Denver for the course “Problems of Modern Society.” That general education
course was developed by many professors from many disciplines shortly after the end of the
World War II. The only part of that collection of syllabi known to have been exclusively written
by Foster is “The Theory of Institutional Adjustment,” (1948) published in the Journal of
Economic Issues of December, 1981. The two parts included here--”The Social Process” (1947)
and “The Problem of Value” (1949)--were probably written by committees, but clearly reveal the
influence of Foster’s pattern of analysis.</p>
<p class="about">The final entry is the paper delivered by Baldwin Ranson at the 2008 meeting of the Association
for Evolutionary Economics, clarifying and defending Foster’s analysis of value theory.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>Introduction.</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            Human knowledge and experience may be classified
for convenience into four branches, each of which clusters about a great
central theme.  Thus, the physical sciences cluster about the study of
inorganic (nonliving) matter; the biological sciences deal with organic
(living) things; the humanities find their unity in the common interest in
human feelings, expression, creation and aspiration; and the social sciences
compose a separately classifiable broad field because of their concern with
man’s associative (group) life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            These broad fields are not actually separate and
distinct, one from another.  They are so identified and described purely for
purposes of convenience, ease of study, accuracy in methodology, and also
because they can be used as preparations for distinctive occupations such as
physicist, journalist, physician, minister, astronomer, teacher, artist,
engineer, businessman, and many others.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            The present course deals with that growing body
of scientific knowledge about man’s social life in groups, usually referred to
as the social sciences.  As one of the four great branches of human knowledge,
the social sciences have certain distinctive characteristics which identify
them as such.  It is the purpose of this essay to describe some of these
characteristics, especially as they focus upon the social process which acts as
a nucleus for the broad field of the social sciences.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>The Object of Social Inquiry.</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            In dealing with mankind’s social life, the
social scientist can never get far away from the fact that he is dealing with
society in transition--in process of continual change.  There is no way to
escape the reality of change in social affairs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            This is true because human society never ceases
to respond to changes of all sorts; natural changes, cultural changes,
technological changes.  The process of change never stops, freezes, petrifies
or comes to rest.  A moment’s reflection will confirm the validity of this
notion that reality is always changing.  For, as a wise Greek philosopher once
said, “no man can step in the same river twice.”  In the instant between the
first step and the second step, both the man and the river have changed; and
neither can be “recaptured” in its identical form of the instant before.  Time
and change have intervened.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            So it is with the flow of the social process.
Social change is the gross continuing effect of millions of smaller and mere
individual changes taking place in all things and in all people all the time. 
Change is inherent even in the electromagnetic structure of atomic matter
itself.  It reveals itself to the social scientist in myriad ways, making the
study of the social process a complex and difficult task.  But since social
change and the continuing flow of the social process is a verifiable fact, we
have no alternative except to make our inquiry as accurate and as significant as
possible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            Social inquiry, then, can be significant only in
so far as it deals with the social process in all its complexity or in so far
as it contributes to that effect.  All social scientists share the social
process with one another.  It is the object of their cooperative inquiry.  Some
of these social scientists call themselves after the several aspects of the
social process which evoke their special interests, such as: Anthropologist,
Economist, Geographer, Journalist, Historian, Political Scientist, Sociologist,
Social Psychologist or specialist in International Affairs.  Still others like
Educators, Social Philosophers, Lawyers and Social Service Workers are
concerned with special aspects of the social process.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            But all of these categories and many others are
unified in to the same broad field by their shared interest in man’s
associative life in groups as it is carried on within the stream of the social
process.  The social process therefore forms the unifying nucleus of the social
sciences, and it is, therefore, the proper object of social inquiry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>The Social Process and the Social Order.</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            The social process, like a broad river, flows
through time unceasingly.  It can never be studied comprehensively in its
wholeness without reference to movement, mutation, modification and change. 
But even so, it is sometimes both possible and desirable to stop this flow of
change at a given instant in time, in order to study a given institution or
group of institutions within the social process.  This artificial device is
something like taking a flash picture of a waterfall with a very fast lens. 
The effect is to “freeze” the actual action-flow.  It is sometimes desirable to
do this in order to help the social scientist make sense out of an otherwise
bewilderingly complex social interaction.  The picture thus produced is never
“real” in the sense of complete accuracy, but it is real enough to support a
useful level of generalization about specific social problems.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            In this manner we can put together a series of
these flash pictures in such a way as to be able to trace through time the
evolution of almost any given social institution, such as the family, the
economy, the church, the nation-state or the political order.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            When these pictures of various institutions are
in turn sequentially put together we can get some idea of the “social order” at
any given era.  For the social order may be thought of as the totality of the
interacting institutions during any given span of years or decades.  And it is
within this meaning that we give such names to cultural epochs as “Victorian,”
or “Periclean,” or “Elizabethan;” or more broadly yet, “Restoration,” Colonial
Era,” and “Postwar.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            These are undoubtedly high-level
generalizations.  Yet at the same time they are distinctly useful to the social
scientist as he attempts to study the social process in its constant evolution
from one social order into the next.  If we assume, however, that we have
succeeded in recreating an exact and substantial picture of a social order
which is not also in a constant state of change and flux, then this device of
stopping the flow of the social process can lead to inaccuracy and
self-negation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>The Social Order and Social Institutions.</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            The social order is comprised of social
institutions.  One reason why stopping the flow of the social process by
“artificial means” is especially useful is to allow the social investigator to
analyze the social institutions which make up a given social order.  These is
extremely important to the social scientist because it is through social
institutions--and only through social institutions--that the social process
impinges upon individual persons in society.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            None can escape living within social
institutions and, indeed, most of us would not care to escape.  From the moment
of birth into the world, human individuals are involved with other humans in
institutional circumstances.  A moment’s recasting of one’s own life
substantiates this statement of fact.  The individual is born into the
institution of the family; plays as a child in neighborhood gangs; is educated
in institutions called schools; worships in the institution of the church;
joins fraternal clubs; serves, perhaps, in institutions of national defense;
earns a living in economic institutions; joins a political party, a
professional or trade society, and so on.  At all times he is a citizen of a
locality (municipality), a state, a region, a nation, and--in our day--of the
world.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            There is no escaping institutional life. It is
the only means by which the social process can bestow the blessings, as well as
deposit the problems and conflicts, of associative life upon the individual
person.  It is through the hundreds of social institutions of the social order
that the social process provides life and its qualitative promises for each
individual person. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            The importance of life as it is lived within
institutional patterns can hardly be overestimated.  Institutions are decisive
in molding us into the persons we are.  In a sense we are the prisoners of our
institutional environment, the victims of our past experiences.  For social
institutions (groups) prescribe our every action.  They influence our manner of
speech and prescribe the language we use in communication; they dictate our
dress,mould our habits of thought, specify our habits of eating, our manners,
our relations with our own and the opposite sex, oversee what we learn, what we
hope for, reward us for conformity and punish us for transgression.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            In a word, institutions control, guide, educate,
and influence our every interaction with the human environment of ideas,
habits, and human relations both past and present.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            It is obvious that if the social process occurs
through social institutions, and if the social process is the proper object of
inquiry among the social sciences, then social institutions are of key
importance.  Their origin, framework, operation, maintenance, growth,
continuity and (sometimes) demise are the stuff and substance with which the
social sciences must deal.  When all the social institutions of a given time
are taken together, they may be said to comprise the social order of that
particular moment in history.  It follows, therefore, that if the social
sciences are to have real significance, they must focus their attention upon
social institutions, and address themselves to the social problems within these
institutions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            For it is only when social institutions
efficiently perform the duties for which they were created that a
smooth-flowing social process is possible,.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>The Purpose of the Social Process.</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            Society is the great invention of men who are
born into a world not made for them.  Although in legend mankind commenced life
in a Garden of Eden, he has long since left that happy state.  Men have wants
the world does not supply without working, and men have needs whose
satisfaction comprises the terms of the life struggle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            Social institutions are man-made devices for
making life secure, easier, richer, less risky and more abundant and
attractive.  Mankind found out long ago that the frictions and conflicts of
group life were outweighed many times over by the dividends of working together
in cooperative association.  The fact that man as a species was capable of
learning this great lesson made him capable of dominating the earth despite his
relative physical weakness, the burden of an enormously long period of child
nurture, his lack of protective body hair, and his inferiority of scent and
other requisites of survival in a hostile world.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            As a life-loving, death-fearing animal, man’s
only recourse has been to seek perpetuation of life through pooled intelligence
and cooperative enterprise.  He has sought--and still seeks--to make his world
as secure, as full, and as satisfying as the terms of life struggle will
allow.  Moreover, as man has accumulated a vast heritage of useful experience
(and has become able to communicate it on a global scale), he has developed his
ability to control his less-than-garden-of-Eden environment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            By developing the resources of scientific
curiosity; by improving his industrial arts; by peering into the nature of the
human mind, emotions, and personality; and by creating leisure in which to
speculate about human purposes, he has raised himself in a bare 100 centuries
to a substantial level of material abundance and security within which to
contemplate beauty, to pursue creative happiness beyond mere animal existence,
and to engage in the activities and arts of the good life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            The vehicle by which this astounding progress
has been made has been society.  That is to say, men in association with one
another in various social institutions have lived, worked, and achieved<u>
together</u> that correlation of life activities we call progress.  The social
process--the flow of change through the institutions of the social order--has
increasingly become the only means by which men can seek to anticipate, to
welcome, and to direct intelligently the changing reality which is the central
fact of human existence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            When viewed in these terms, the social process
loses much of its inevitability and fearsomeness.  If society--that is, the
institutions of the social order--is man-made, then it can be altered by man. 
Indeed, this is precisely what Thomas Jefferson meant when he made recourse to
the “right of revolution” in justifying the birth of the American nation in
1776.  For he was able to perceive that the social order is the tool, not the
master, of mankind, and that it can be refashioned and redirected into new
channels and newer forms more efficient and more beneficial than formerly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            Jefferson’s implication is scientifically true. 
It is that the social process should be fashioned by man to serve two great
ends: 1) the protection of men from preventable death (the inalienable right to
life and liberty), and 2) the provision of life’s qualitative promises (the
inalienable right to the pursuit of happiness).  In his memorable Declaration
of Independence, Jefferson proclaimed the deathless integrity of man, and of
man’s right to redirect the social process and refashion his social institutions
to serve not only the few but all men.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            Now it is obvious that the social process does
not provide all men today with either an assured existence or the fullest
possible measure of life’s potential promises.  It is this failure--this
inefficiency--of successive orders through history to arrange the flow of the
social process so as to make the maximum provision of life and its promises
that gives meaning and significance to the study of the social sciences.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            For when Jefferson spoke of the inalienable rights
of life and liberty, his thought was that society serves men most efficiently
when it protects men against the derangements of wars.  To this thought, other
philosophers and statesmen have since added the concept that the social process
must be arranged so as to provide other things, such as protection against
accident, illness, old-age and unemployment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            And when Jefferson spoke of the inalienable
right to the pursuit of happiness, his thought was that no social order could
long exist which did not also provide its citizen-members with a measure of
human dignity, achievement, status and belonging, love and companionship--in
short, with the amenities and some of the luxuries, the leisures, the
relaxations and the promises of life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            Jefferson’s notion of judging the social order
by setting it up against the inalienable rights of man is a profound--indeed
even today almost a revolutionary--social instrument.  For it is no less than<u>
a statement of social value</u>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            Using it as the criterion of value, above and
beyond the social institutions which themselves are under reexamination, we
have a scientific means of measuring the achievements and shortcomings of the
social institutions which are the immediate focus of attention in the social
sciences.  And if these social institutions occasionally fail, as they do, to
provide men with life and the maximal consummatory experiences of which these
institutions are capable, then we have at least a clue to the discovery of the
source of this inefficiency and of eradicating the defect on a scientific
(evidential) basis.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            This is the whole object of inquiring into the
social process and into the institutions of the social order through which the
process takes place.  This is the fundamental nature and purpose of the social
sciences.  It is in the constant scientific reexamination of man-made
institutions against the criterion of “instrumental efficiency” that the social
scientist can make his most significant contribution to a smoothly flowing,
that is to say, a peacefully changing and ever-modifying, social process.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            The notion that the social order exists to
provide all men with life and its consummatory promises is a fundamental
concept in the study of the social sciences.  It is fundamental because from it
can be derived some idea of the proper scope of the broad field of social
science, as well as the practical usefulness of social inquiry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            Consciously or subconsciously, all generations
of men have at all times been compelled to fall back upon this final criterion
of instrumental efficiency in order to modify outworn or inefficient social
institutions.  The historical record is filled with examples.  The modification
of the Divine-Right Monarchy in France and England and Russia is one case in
point.  The inability of nation-states to prevent war and the growth of the
United Nations is another.  The inability of unregulated capitalism to prevent
the now-famous “boom and bust” cycle is still another.  There are but three
examples of the types of social problems which confront social scientists in
their search for a peaceful, ever-changing, and smoothly operating social
order.  A longer list of real social problems plaguing various social
institutions would include the disorganization of the family, inequities in the
flow of income, disparities between mutually-exclusive religious beliefs, race
prejudices, the control of atomic and disease-based weapons of mass
destruction.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            How is he to attack these problems with any real
hope of actually resolving the conflicts which create them?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            The social scientist can hardly hope to resolve
all social conflicts by the application of some mystic formula.  But he does
know some things <u>in fact</u>--that is to say, things that are subject to
experiential proof in the entire historical record of human experience, He
knows, for instance:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            Some human societies have attained to a high
degree the benefits of a smoothly flowing social process: security, abundance,
liberty, and experimental development.  Others have attained only an imperfect
and awkwardly organized social process: animal existence, poverty for large numbers,
human exploitation, institutions wedded to traditional practices.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            It is obvious that only in the free society can
the pursuit of social value best take place.  It is obvious <u>from everything
we know</u> about past human institutions that the level of production of the
necessities and abundance of life is coexistent with the degree of experimental
freedom of thought.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            These two things--high-level production and
freedom to change and experiment--are the signal lights of free societies. 
Where they are extinguished, freedom exists usually only for the few in an
economic and political as well as a social sense.  It was this thought that
motivated Thomas Jefferson to lay down the five propositions by which social
institutions (in this case, the state) must be modified when freedom of inquiry
and experiment do not exist.  He said:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            Explicit in the Jeffersonian doctrine is the
declaration of the <u>inalienability of right to experiment</u>--to be wrong as
well as right.  In other words, Jefferson believed that the human being is so
constituted that, short of death, his curiosity can never be taken away, that
experimental inquiry is a function of living itself.  Any society which
believes differently, which attempts to abolish or perpetually to extinguish
curiosity without extinguishing lifeitself, is merely banking the fires for its
own eventual consummation by the flames of revolution.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            As Jefferson continued, “... and accordingly all
experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are
sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are
accustomed ....”  Eventually, the unquenchable and inalienable rights to life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness will correlate into some form, expressing
itself in modifying the offending institution or institutions and recreating
“its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their
safety and happiness.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            But Jefferson was speaking of forceful
revolution as a last resort.  The modern social scientist, with the data of the
historical  laboratory at his elbow, seeks to make free social inquiry into a
tool of peaceful modification and adaptation.  Using it properly, he seeks to
conduct his investigations into the various institutional structures of his
society in such a way as to produce a “plurality of alternatives” by which to
resolve the social conflicts and problems that continually arise in response to
continuous social change.  His motive at all times is to propose alternative
solutions to social problems which society at large can use to be tested in
experience and in practical operation, and then to modify and to examine once
again “in such forms as to [it] shall seem most likely to effect [its] safety
and happiness.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            The truly free society does not penalize one
alternative solution in advance.  As in a fair race, the competitors do not injure
one another or seek to trip an opponent while racing toward the goal.  So with
alternative ideas for resolving social problems; no liability is imposed before
the race of experiential testing is completed, and no recrimination or revenge
is visited upon the loser.  In the free society, individuals are left free to
choose between competing ideas which serve them and their purposes better than
others.  And even when once accepted by the majority, a given idea or belief is
always held subject to reexamination, modification, and revision--even as
conditions, ideas, things and people themselves change with time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            At the root of the free society is the
realization that the social process, like a broad river flowing, is always <u>becoming</u>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            The social sciences are but one of the four
great branches of knowledge through which mankind can hope for a social process
which makes it the beneficiary, not the victim, of change.  Through the social
sciences, the modern student has access--not only to the vast body of data collected
by the various fields within the social sciences, but also to a scientific
method of dealing with social data which can contribute in large measure to the
dissolution of the forces of hate, greed, misery and ignorance which lie like
festering sores deep with the social process of modern times.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            But the free society and social order most
likely to survive its capacity for its own self-destruction is the one--and
only that one--which is willing to submit its basic foundations to constant and
candid scientific criticism.  This necessitates the vigorously protected right
by all men everywhere to apply the standards of scientific criticism even to
the most sacred and obviously unquestionable justifications of a given social
order. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            Wherever men have been associated in society,
they have sought answers to the question of the nature and purpose of social
organization.  What constitutes the “good life?”  What is the end or goal or
value to which men should aspire?  It is such questions as these that
constitute the problem of value.  The answers that men have given are important
because our ideas about what ought to be constitute the criterion of judgment
which we use when confronted with the necessity or possibility of making
choices in the attempted solution of a problem.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            While we are now in a position to see that there
is some scientific evidence which can aid us in solving our social problems,
does this mean that it is no longer necessary to concern ourselves with the
question of what is desirable?  The answer is that there does not seem to be
any way of escaping the necessity for considering what ought to be.  But it is
in their context as criteria of judgment that we must concern ourselves with
concepts of value.  This is so because it is in this connection that they are
involved in the attempted solution of social problems.  The solution of social
problems involves the necessity for making choices.  Man cannot escape the
necessity for social action, and such activity necessarily involves some prior
choice-making wherever it is not determined by habitual behavior patterns.  To
refuse to make a choice in a situation where action of some sort is inescapable
is, in effect, to make one.  The decision to maintain the status quo unchanged
is itself a choice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            The making of choices involves the application
of some criterion of judgment--some concept of the desirable which serves as
the reference point in the selection from among available alternatives.  This
is true of the choices that men make in their attempts to solve social
problems.  For example, if we are considering the problem of unemployment, and
it is found that full employment can be maintained only by increasing public
control over some parts of the economy, on what basis do we decide that it is
desirable to do so?  Are there not moral values in “free enterprise” which are
more important than maintaining full employment?  If it be true that security
can be achieved only at the expense of freedom (as many people contend) which
of these is the more valuable goal?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            In the analysis of social problems, solutions
always take the form of choices from among available alternatives  which exist
as institutional structures.  When confronted with the problem of housing, do
we decide to leave home-building exclusively in the hands of private
enterprise, provide government subsidies to homebuilders and purchasers, have
the government build housing projects, facilitate the setting up of
cooperatives, set up the institutional means for killing off that part of the
population which cannot find homes, or adopt some other alternative or combination
of alternatives?  The character of the answer chosen--the institutional pattern
selected--will be determined by the criterion of judgment employed.  It is
clear that the problem of value, in the sense of criterion of judgment, cannot
be escaped.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            The problem now becomes that of whether criteria
of judgment are themselves subject to rational analysis or whether, after all,
there is no rational way to judge between them and, therefore, no rational way
to solve social problems.  In this regard, it needs to be emphasized that these
criteria do not exist independently of the social interaction which is taking
place in the group in which they are applied.  In each case they rest at bottom
on some conception of human nature, some idea of what sort of being the human
animal is.  As such, we are entitled to inquire whether their validity is
subject to examination in the light of the hypotheses which emerge from the
actual study of human relations. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            There is no reason to believe that any criterion
of judgment is somehow mysteriously divorced from and logically independent of
the “observed regularities” of human behavior discussed earlier.  Since such
criteria become meaningful only as they are used as the reference point in the
organization of human behavior and the attempt to solve social problems, they
may be required legitimately to meet the test of such evidence as we have about
the behavior of human beings.  The criterion of judgment used to solve economic
problems within the framework of business enterprise, for example, is based on
the concept of the “economic man.”   This is a theory which no longer can be
held to be valid in the light of the mores principle.  We are now able to see
that the classical economists were confusing some aspects of the human behavior
which they saw around them in their society with an immutable, inherent human
nature.  Yet judgments continue to be made on this basis.  Witness current
discussions with regard to the problems of housing, inflation, medical care,
educational facilities, etc.  Much the same difficulty is inherent in the
communist criterion of judgment.  The class struggle, upon examination, is
found to be the same sort of thing as the “invisible hand.”  This is not to be
wondered at, since both theories are the result of the same sort of thinking
about social affairs.  They both represent “absolute truths” which must be
accepted through an act of faith and do not stand the test of inquiry.  All
such non-scientifically based criteria of judgment--including at the present
time fascism, communism, and laissez-faire--have several things in common.  A
closer examination of these similarities may be of help at this point.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>Characteristics of Non-scientifically-based Criteria of
Judgment.</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            In the first place, all such theories find
validity in a certain fixed pattern of institutions.  Whether it be the
noninterference by government in the economic life of the community and the
determination of economic policy exclusively by the owners of property (laissez
faire), the complete absence of private property and policy determination by
the dictatorship of the proletariat (communism), or the superiority of some
racial or cultural group and determination of policy by the “naturally
superior” through the institution of the party (fascism)--no matter which of
these theories is involved, its aims are to be achieved through some particular
set of institutions.  But we know that institutions change, and we know that
the only way to solve real social problems is by changing institutions.  We know
that any theory based on values which are to be realized through some
particular institutional pattern, though it may seem to present easy answers to
problems, is in fact incapable of solving those problems.  The character of the
social process and the dynamic nature of invention make such easy answers
impossible.  If it is necessary to change institutions in order to solve social
problems, then we know that, whatever criterion of judgment is to be used, it
cannot be such as to require any particular pattern of institutions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            Similarly, and for the same reasons, any valid
criterion of judgment must be independent of the institutional structure in
which the judgment is to be made.  Otherwise, nothing more than a justification
of the very institutions which need to be modified can occur.  In other words,
while cultural prescriptions dictate habitual behavior patterns, where problems
arise these habitual patterns must be modified.  The prevailing dictates of the
culture which regulate this particular phase of social activity must, then, be
critically appraised and modified, and this requires a criterion of judgment
which is exterior to the institutions being examined.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            The second characteristic of such theories
results from the previously noted fact that any criterion of social judgment
rests on some conception of human nature.  In this case, this theory of human
nature is not based upon scientific analysis of the biological and social
characteristics of men living in groups, but is based upon some preconceptions
about human nature.  These preconceptions seek to establish invidious
distinctions between people.  By invidious, we mean alleged distinctions of
relative worth or ability which are not drawn from and cannot be verified by
rational analysis of the evidence.  They represent judgments about the relative
worth of individuals, and they generally come to focus in the matter of policy
determination, for the power to determine social policy is the power to
prescribe the conditions of social life for all of the member of a community. 
Thus, it may be held that one race is inherently superior to all others, that
the proletariat is somehow the highest class in society, that the owners of
property are peculiarly endowed with the capacity to make decisions.  In each
case, the assumed inequality between men is used as the criterion of what is
desirable in social affairs.  In each case, this assumed inequality is held to
be a valid reason for allowing some group of people to decide policies which
affect the lives of others.  This is accomplished by identifying the interests
and welfare of the “superior” group with the interests of the community at
large, and it is held that the well-being of the elite is an accurate index to
the well-being of the society.  In each case, this assumed inequality is
invidious (unscientific) because it rests on assumptions which cannot be
proved, or it is an unwarranted imputation of moral worth from real individual
differences.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            It is this sort of judgment, which is at the
bottom of all prejudice.  Certain common sense appreciations of surface
differences between people--skin pigmentation, hair texture, facial
characteristics, etc.--are held to be evidence of relative worth or
instrumental capacities of the individuals concerned, and are held to be
sufficient evidence for denying to this group opportunities for full
participation in the social system--always, of course, in their own best
interest since they are “inferior.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Characteristics
of a Scientific Criterion of Judgment.</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            These characteristics of nonscientific criteria
of judgment represent clues as to the way the scientific method can be applied
positively to the problem of making choices.  We can distinguish at least three
positive identifications of a valid criterion of judgment in social affairs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            In the first place, the basis for judging must
take account of the reality and inevitability of change.  This means that our
criterion of judgment must be constructed in terms of process rather than
structure.  It must be outside of and independent of any specific sorts of
institutions, since we are judging from among institutional structures.  This
implies a criterion which does not specify any stable, continuous pattern of
institutions, but one which recognizes that a continuously expanding technology
makes institutional change inevitable.  The process of change, motivated by the
enlarging area of human activity in which scientific explanation occurs, must
itself be the reference point for a valid criterion of judgment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            This does not at all imply that institutions are
unimportant, nor does it mean that stability and continuity in institutional
life are not social imperatives. It is necessary to repeat that social activity
takes place through institutions, and that social change is accomplished
through the modification of institutions.  The point is that the criterion of
judgment employed must be independent of the prevailing mores if real, rational
choice is to be possible .  Nor does it mean that all of the mores of a
community must be modified to solve its problems.  The habits of thought in a
democratic society, for example, which may properly be called mores and which
constitute the habit of referring to non-coercive, nonviolent solutions to
problems may be validated by a scientific criterion of judgment since they
constitute a basic condition for rational choice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            In the second place, a valid criterion must
provide the opportunity for real, rational choices to be made.  That is to say,
it must take into account the determinants of the problems to which it is to be
applied.  It must be rooted in reality--in the “observed regularities” among
the items involved in the problem.  It must recognize and be based on the
realities of the culture concept and the principles of social change.  It must
start from where we are in the realities of the problems encountered, and at
the same time, it must provide a conception of where we ought to be.  It must
bridge the gap between what is and what ought to be.  This means that there
must be an explicit connection between the two, and that what is viewed as
desirable must not be divorced from what is possible.  This condition can only
be met by a recognition of the relationship between personality and culture--an
understanding of the habitual behavior of people (what is), and a recognition
of the nature of social change--an understanding of the way that people can
change their behavior patterns in order to solve the problems created by an
expanding technology (what ought to be).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            Thirdly, judgments about social affairs which
can be held to be valid must be instrumental rather than invidious in
character.  When judgments are made on invidious grounds, they can only
intensify the problem which exists.  The racial problem, for example, is the
problem of the denial of the opportunity for effective participation to
minority groups on the basis of assumptions of invidious differences between
races.  Any attempt to solve it on invidious grounds cannot possibly resolve
the problem.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            We are here considering the belief systems held
by people in any society.  These belief systems are important data in social
analysis.  But they are important in the same way that men’s ideas about
disease before the discovery of bacteria were important.  They do not provide
us with the basis for making judgments about current problems any more than the
explanation of disease as punishment for sin provides the modern medical
researcher with a tool for curing cancer.  Social science can provide people
with a way of thinking about social affairs which will enable them to solve
their social problems only insofar as we are able to apply to the relationships
between human beings a way of thinking which meets the same logical conditions
as that which has characterized advances in physical knowledge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            The advances in the reliability of our knowledge
about the physical world have been achieved through the sort of thinking that
we have been calling <u>instrumental</u>.  We have been able to solve physical
problems as our approach to them has come to be based, not on preconceptions
about their nature, but on “observed regularities” in the phenomena disclosed
by observation of the facts in the case.  In the case of man’s relationship to
man (institutional life), man’s thinking has commonly been invidious in character. 
The task now ahead for civilized man is the construction of judgment drawn from
an investigation of the way that human beings do, and have, in fact behaved.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            By way of summing up, it is clear that science
does not provide us with a way of escaping the necessity for making value
judgments in social affairs.  But it is also clear that the method of science
does provide us with a way of bringing our value judgments into closer
correlation with the facts of social life.  It does provide us with a way of
making such judgments as will enable us to solve problems.  In fact, the
validity of the instrumental approach to social affairs, as distinguished from
the invidious, is to be found in the fact that it is the method by which
problems may be solved.  Moreover, this way of thinking about social affairs
enables us to escape the conclusion that there is no way to decide between the
relative validity of different institutions and social theories.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            The significance of what has been said for the
central problem of the competing theories of government in the world today
should also be considered.  For of all these theories, democracy--the
determination of social policy by those who will be affected by the
policy--would seem to most nearly approximate the conditions discussed above. 
It is within the framework of the democratic process that a free, uncoerced
choice from among alternatives can be made.  Democracy alone among the
available theories of social organization does not specify any particular pattern
of institutions.  Democracy alone makes no invidious distinctions between
people and specifies that it is only within such a framework that the real,
instrumental differences between people may be realized.  Democracy provides,
in the long run, the alternative which is capable of constantly adjusting
itself to changed conditions--of continuously solving the problems which it
confronts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            It may be true that such assertions are valid
only on the basic assumption that it is desirable to solve problems.  If so, it
does no material harm to the position here stated, since no one can deny the
validity of problem-solving without denying the very nature of life.  In fact,
all social theories have laid claim to potency in the matter of solving 
problems.  The point we have been emphasizing is that these problems are
objectively determined and that they can be viewed as cause-effect sequences. 
As we approach the matter of human relations with this clearly in view, there
is reason for hope that we can develop the techniques for solving those
problems.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>What is a Social Problem?</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            We are now in a position to consider what we
mean by a social problem.  It should already be clear that social problems are
related somehow to the fact of continuous social change.  In fact, social
conflicts or problems may be viewed as symptoms of social change.  Conflicts
arise in society when two or more aspects of the social process are
inefficiently correlated--more specifically, when the invidious bases of
institutions interfere with their ability to maintain the social process at the
level which the available tools and techniques make possible.  Social problems
are not dependent, then, on the subjective awareness of their existence by
members of the community.  Unemployment is a social problem when the economic
institutional arrangements make it impossible to maintain a level of full
employment in a technological situation which is capable of supporting full
employment.  To put it another way, a social problem exists where members of a
community are denied access to the full measure of participation in society
which their own energies and capacities and the available technology make
possible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            Because this is the case, social problems can
only be solved by the modification or replacement of the institutions which
have failed to correlate human behavior efficiently.  We have, of course, been
assuming that it is the behavior of <u>individuals</u> which is being
correlated inefficiently.  It follows that, while social problems may be said
to exist independently of the awareness of the individuals concerned, it is
also true that the effort to solve a problem will not be made until the members
of the society are conscious of the existence of the problem.  And the effort
cannot be successful until they are aware of the factors which have caused the
problem and are thereby equipped to deal with it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>Social Problems and the Individual.</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            While any particular pattern of institutions is
a cross-section of the social process, these institutions are reflected in the
behavior  patterns of the individuals in that society. Institutions may also,
therefore, be said to exist in the minds of individuals.  The judgments of any
society as to right and wrong, permissible and forbidden sorts of human
activity which are expressed in institutions, become cultured, ingrained habits
of thought and action in the members of that society.  In the language of the
social psychologists, people tend to “interiorize” the social norms which are
current in their institutions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            The activities which the norms of any society
prescribe become habitual and their execution almost unconscious.  At the same
time, the norms themselves--the values and basic assumptions on which these
behavior patterns are based--are accepted, for the most part, uncritically. 
Indeed, many individuals are not even aware of their existence.  The result is
that they tend to become “evidence-proof formulae.”  They remain tacit
assumptions that people are not prepared to question or have questioned or to
refer to the test of evidence for proof.  When they are attacked, the reaction
is personal and emotional.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            Some of these established ways of doing things
are more commonly and deeply ingrained in the minds of individuals than others,
of course.  In American society, for example, most people would consider it
immoral--and suffer real discomfort--if forced to use someone else’s
toothbrush, and feel it a personal affront when the sanctity of the traditional
institution of the family is called into question.  These are matters about
which the American community’s institutional prescriptions are widely and
deeply held.  On the other hand, the appearance of women in public in the “old
look” is probably not yet accounted serious enough to bring deep social
disapproval.  The attempt by advertising methods to make the “new look” a
serious social prescription has not come up to the hopes or expectations of the
ladies’ apparel industry.  In the matter of dress, the varying degrees in which
social prescriptions become involved with emotions is clearly evident.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            While much of human activity is habitual and
dictated in the manner described above by the existing institutional pattern,
it is also true that the pressure to solve real social problems results in a
conscious decision on the part of individuals to modify these habitual behavior
patterns and institute new patterns of relationships among the individuals in
the community.  This decision amounts to a conscious choice from among the
various alternative solutions to the problem which are available.  It is a
different sort of activity than the unconscious obedience to custom which we
have been considering.  And it is the only sort of activity which is capable of
solving problems.  This sort of real, rational choice by the individuals concerned
can only be made when they have become sufficiently aware of the restraints
which established institutional behavior put on their ability to live more
meaningfully and abundantly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            Because all individuals live in society and,
therefore, within the institutions of their society (with the rare exception of
the hermit), it becomes necessary for them to adjust themselves to the
requirements of their society.  But the adjustment of individuals to
society--to things as they are--does not mean that people must be taught to
regard the institutions in which they live as permanent or perfect
arrangements.  If this could be accomplished, the result would be mass
stagnation or suicide since a society composed of such individuals would not be
able to modify itself as change becomes necessary.  A healthy society, then, is
one composed of individuals who recognize the inevitability of change and are
prepared to solve their problems by the rational modification of their
institutions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            It is not enough, therefore, to have citizens
who are well-adjusted to what is.  In the long run, healthy individuals cannot
exist in a sick society. Consider, for example, what the consequences of
adjusting individuals to the social structure of Fascism meant to the world.  A
well-adjusted little Nazi can hardly be said to be a healthier and sounder
individual than a poorly adjusted one who finds it exceedingly difficult to
live in the Fascist society.  In the case of the migratory workers in the United
States, the social problem is obviously not one of convincing the migrant that
he should be happy in spite of the fact that his family is hungry, ill-housed,
diseased and deprived of any educational facilities.  Nor is it a matter of
enrolling him in night school so that he can study to be a salesman or a
mechanic.  If all migrants were transferred to stores and factories, the
agricultural crops would lie unharvested.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            The social problem here lies in the fact that a
substantial portion of the American community is denied access to the full
participation in the economic process that our technology makes possible.  And
the level of participation of the rest of the community is lowered to the same
degree, since they are denied the socially useful results of the contribution
that the migrants might make.  In short, the concern of social science is with
the character of the society to which individuals are to adjust.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            Every individual in society has many personal
problems which may range all the way from inferiority complexes to inability to
find housing facilities.  Many of these problems are in reality the incidence
of a social problem on the individual.  For example, it s not inconceivable
that a veteran today might find himself in the position of not being able to
find a job, having to house his family in a chicken-coop, not being able to
provide an adequate diet for his family, and of having frequent and violent
quarrels with his wife.  Now it is also conceivable that, by conferring with
experts trained in rehabilitation work, he might be able to work out these
difficulties--to solve his problems.  The individual may in effect, lift
himself by his bootstraps. Certainly it is desirable that effort be exerted to
this end.  But solving personal problems does not solve social problems.  The
claim that it does rests on a confusion between these two sorts of problems.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            By getting a job, a house, and working out his
difficulties with his wife, this veteran will not thereby have solved the <u>social</u>
problems of unemployment, housing, inflation, and the organization of the
family of which his personal problems were symptoms.  These are problems which
are occasioned not by weakness or deficiencies in any particular individuals,
but by the fact that the institutions of that society do not effectively
correlate the activities of individuals so that all are provided with the
opportunity for the fullest expression of their potentialities.  And they can
be solved in only one way: by the modification of the institutions involved so that
full use may be made of the available scientific knowledge of the community. 
The solution by individuals of their personal problems is, of course, a
desirable end.  But the conditions under which this is possible for <u>all</u>
individuals can only be accomplished when individuals realize that many of
their personal problems are only symptomatic of social maladjustment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            This confusion of personal and social problems
is also responsible for the emotional approach to the solution of problems
which, however commendable in intent, serves to prolong the existence of the
problem itself.  Very often, for example, a genuinely admirable concern for the
poor or the “unfortunate,” when accompanied by a failure to see the reality of
the social problem involved, leads to the conclusion that the answer lies in
public or private charity.  But charity is not a<u> solution</u> to the problem
of poverty.  The problem itself can only be solved by the rational attempt to
get at its causes.  As a social phenomenon, the problem of poverty--like other
economic problems--is located in those social arrangements which determine the
rules of the game in the matter of how men “make a living” in society.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            Nor does the solution of social problems consist
in the effort to assess moral praise </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>or blame to any individual or group or class of
individuals.  Social science is not concerned with this sort of moral judgment,
since it is not capable of solving problems.  The determinants of problems lie
elsewhere, and it is only by the rational attempt to discover what these
determinants are and what alternatives are available that problems may be
solved.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>Why Solve Social Problems?</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            The serious attempt to solve social problems is
an exciting adventure in the interplay of forces which are within human control
and those which are not.  The rational decision to modify institutions is
within the area of choice of man, even though its exercise requires intelligent
reexamination of long-established habits.  At the same time, there are
considerations in problem-solving which are outside human control.  The
limitations of the physical environment are an obvious example.  Not so obvious
is the proposition that any attempt to solve social problems must take as given
data the level of scientific knowledge which is available, and that to effect a
solution is to provide new institutional arrangements which will make fuller
use of this knowledge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            It is this latter fact which makes
problem-solving necessary.  Social change is made necessary and inevitable by
the fact that established institutions cannot make full use of new discoveries
and inventions--of new ideas, tools, and techniques.  The social process has
ceased in some way to proceed efficiently.  Since the social process affects
individuals through institutions--prescribed patterns of human behavior--its
efficiency depends on the efficiency of the structural institutions and
arrangements which compose it in any given cultural order.   It is inevitable,
therefore, that in seeking to make their lives meaningful, men will continue to
modify their institutions. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            But why worry and work at the matter?  Why not
let the social process run its course and let social problems take care of
themselves?  Perhaps the best answer to these questions lies in the fact that
the quality of the lives of every individual in a society depends in large part
on the quality of the social arrangements which are in effect.  To the degree
that any members of a society are precluded from effective participation, the
society itself is a sick society, and every member of it is affected thereby.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            Moreover, failure to solve social problems
rationally invites non-rational attempts to do the same thing.  These
non-rational attempts take the form of the substitution of violence for
discussion and reasoned analysis, and adopt the method of war and revolution. 
Especially in an atomic age--but, of course, in any age--widespread use of
force and violence may make social survival itself impossible.  Increasingly,
modern man becomes aware of the truth of the charge that the alternative to the
rational modification of his institutions is death or, at best, a badly
crippled community.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'> </span></span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>           The meaning of this
assertion hinges on the nature of the criterion of judgment  and what it means
to apply it.  Foster saw the criterion of judgment as a tool applied (used)
constantly in every person’s life.  </span></p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            A primary characteristic
of human life is the endless generation and pursuit of ends-in-view.  Whenever
conventional or habitual behavior is blocked, people must make judgments and
choices about what to do next.  Each decision maps one step forward in a
person’s life, aimed at changing present situations into desired futures. 
Bertrand de Jouvenal called decisions “conjectures” about available futures; he
considered conjectures to be a “need of our species.”(chapter 2)</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Regardless of immediate
intent, the generic function of a decision is to continue the process of
choosing by selecting a course of behavior thought to be capable of linking a
present “what is” to a future “what ought-to-be.”  Foster variously identified
the instrumental criterion guiding decisions linking present and future as
“efficiency” (1981:930,944) and as “developmental continuity”
(1981:944,959,1010).  Its current popular expression is “sustainability.”   It
is applied by asking “What will work?”  “Which next step appears most efficient
for continuing my life process?”   Foster considered this pursuit of continuity
“an attribute of human judgment”(93), itself not subject to choice because
there is no genuine alternative between continuing and ending one’s life
process.(138).          </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Almost no one denies the
existence of an instrumental criterion.  And almost no one accepts Foster’s
claim that it is the only applicable criterion of judgment.  Examining three
objections to his claim will clarify his position.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Some economists (e.g.,
Bush, 85,91), influenced by Veblen’s distinction between instrumental and
ceremonial behavior, add to Foster’s instrumental criterion a ceremonial
criterion.<a href="#_ftn375" name="_ftnref375" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[375]</span></span></span></a>  A valuation is identified as
ceremonial when it claims effectiveness that is not warranted by its
consequences.  But a ceremonial criterion would mean choosing a course of
action BECAUSE it is expected to be ineffective.  Recognizing a ceremonial
criterion as well as  an instrumental criterion would mean that sometimes one
chooses what one thinks will work, and at other times what one thinks will NOT
work.  We deny that anyone ever applies a ceremonial criterion of judgment. 
Choices are always instrumental in intent.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Some philosophers (e.g.,
Habermas, 9) add to Foster’s instrumental criterion an ethical and a moral
criterion, dividing “what ought-to-be” into three distinct species: pragmatic
[the instrumental], ethical [the good], and moral [the just].  But this
division denies the unity and continuity of human experience.  Foster insisted
that these three names all refer to a single trait of desirability:
continuity.  What ought-to-be because it achieves continuity is the same as
what ought-to-be morally and ethically--the position adopted by “deep ecology”
(Capra, 7, 11, 297).</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Some reviewers reject
Foster’s single criterion as patently absurd because it entails Jesus--the
epitome of good--and Hitler--the epitome of evil--applying the same theory of value. 
That objection ignores Foster’s careful distinction between value--the
universal criterion of judgment not subject to human discretion--and
valuation--any particular application of value which is always subject to human
discretion.  Jesus judged that love was the effective means for sustaining
humanity, while Hitler judged that fear of power of the master race was the
effective means.  Both pursued continuity, regardless of how instrumental
(i.e., successful, ethical) their means proved to be.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Turning from the critics,
here is Foster’s statement of the factual nature of both the criterion of
continuity and what ought-to-be to achieve continuity:</p>

They recognize that walking is a more efficient form of locomotion than crawling. 
They make repeated efforts and, through trial and error, learn that certain
movements of legs and body maintain balance and permit movement forward, while
others do not.(96 ff.)  This learning process epitomizes what Veblen called
workmanship and Dewey and Ayres called instrumental judgment and behavior. 
Clearly, infants apply the criterion of developmental continuity in a manner
which, when perfected, becomes scientific inquiry:</span></span></p>

capable of achieving future satisfaction: “Whether it is pleasure and pain or
otherwise, you still have the theory of value to explain.”(117-8)  As evidence,

VALUE.  </span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Almost
as universal as the utility theory is the practice of identifying power as the
criterion of judgment.  Its most virulent manifestation is generally considered
to be Fascism, which Foster defined<span class=Normal1><span style='font-family:
Arial'> as “a system in which power is the theory and the criterion of
value.”(210)  He defined power as “the exercise of discretion over others
without responsibility to them,”(212), and granted that power-seeking is a human
trait just like pleasure-seeking.  But it is not a criterion of judgment
capable of linking what is to what should be to achieve continuity.</span></span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span class=Normal1><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>            Fascism rejects
rationality, denying any need to justify power by reason.  It tries to
establish truth by the exercise of power: might makes right; the leader can do
no wrong.  But in pursuit of power, fascists cannot avoid explanation and
reasoning.  In their efforts to apply the theory, their judgments invariably
seek actions expected to establish or continue what they conceive should
be.(95-6)   Efforts to apply that theory fail because power cannot serve as a
criterion pointing to operational links between what is and what should be.  In

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span class=Normal1><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>            Let us return to
Foster’s view of the nature of purposeful choice.  Every choice originates in
an observation that “what is” obstructs one’s life process.  That observation
motivates a search for ends and means to remove that obstruction.  </span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span class=Normal1><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>            The instrumental theory
of value tells one to ask, “What ends and means must I choose next to continue
my life?,” and one sets about identifying next steps.  In our example, infants
behave as if asking themselves “where should I place my foot to advance toward
that table?”  That is, they APPLY the instrumental theory to a developmental
end.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span class=Normal1><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>            The utility theory tells
one to ask, “Am I satisfied?”  In our example, if Crusoe asked, “Should I save
or consume to increase my satisfaction?”  as Bohm- Bawerk advised, he would
have to apply the instrumental criterion in considering alternative paths to
satisfaction--a non-developmental end.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span class=Normal1><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>            Fascist theory tells one
to ask, “Am I powerful?”  If Hitler asked “Would eliminating inferior races
make me more powerful?” he would have to apply the instrumental criterion in
considering alternative paths to power--a non-developmental end.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span class=Normal1><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>            Since the questions
dictated by false theories of value are unrelated to the future, those theories
CANNOT BE APPLIED to guide choices.  One is forced to apply the instrumental
theory in pursuit of pleasure or power as of any other purpose.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span class=Normal1><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>            Every step in this
judging process is subject to human error.  “What is” may be poorly or
mis-specified; the end envisioned may not be developmental; and the means
selected may not be instrumental.  But the error is never applying the wrong
criterion.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span class=Normal1><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>            I suggest two reasons
why we find Foster’s assertion contrary to logic and common sense.  One is the
habit of talking as if any theory is applicable at will, e.g., Hitler was a
fascist and, of course, applied fascism.  This habit fails to distinguish
between genuine and imaginary choices.  And two is the habit of believing that
only means are subject to instrumental validification.  Ends are treated as
immaterial and unverifiable.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span class=Normal1><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>            I conclude that Foster’s
critique of these semantic habits is valid.  The only applicable criterion of
judgment is the instrumental criterion.  Hitler’s intent was continuity--a
thousand year Reich--but his choices brought rapid disaster to him and millions
of others, not because he applied a non-developmental theory of value but
because he tried to apply a false theory.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=Normal1><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=Normal1><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>4.  How useful is Foster’s claim?</span></b></span></p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Recognizing the accuracy
of Foster’s claim is useful, first, in eliminating the common confusion between
a universal criterion and situation-specific applications, a confusion clearly
stated by Anne Mayhew: “What makes institutional economics truly radical is
that there is no ‘ought to be’ that both has usefully specific meaning <i>and</i>
transcends a particular time and place.”(895)  Following Foster, what
ought-to-be at each particular time and place is that action most likely to
contribute transcendentally to the developmental continuity of the entire
community.  Error is located not in the criterion of continuity, but in
understanding its concrete conditions at each moment of choice in each human’s
life process.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span class=Normal1><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>            Secondly, Foster’s
assertion shows how to respond to sterile hermeneutic and relativistic
arguments that value and valuations lack empirical warrant.  The instrumental
criterion reveals the inseparability of judgments of what is from judgments of
what should be.  </span></span> <span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Every
choice involves both.<span class=Normal1><span style='font-family:Arial'>            </span></span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span class=Normal1><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>            Finally, Foster’s claim
confirms that applicability is the final test of the correctness of theories:
“the building of a generalization and the process of verification through
application [are] not separate, nor [can] either exist without the other.”(88)  </span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span class=Normal1><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>            Employing these insights
of Fagg Foster’s would increase our capacity as social scientists to help
society recognize and overcome the ignorance that obstructs its developmental
continuity.</span></span></p>
