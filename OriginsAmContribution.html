<h3 class=Body align=center style='text-align:center'>The Origins of the
American Contribution </h3>
<h4 align=center style='text-align:center'>manuscript fragment</h4>

<p class=Body align=center style='text-align:center'>I</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            In the first chapter of
this inquiry mention was made of the fact that there is something literally
unique, distinguishingly peculiar, about the character of the American cultural
development.  As a consequence of this peculiarity, American analyses of
political-economy have taken a divergent form from that of the Western world
generally.  The function of this chapter is to explain briefly the character,
meaning, and significance of this peculiarly American experience.  In so doing,
some insight and explanation of why American Institutionalism and American
Instrumentalism should have developed into their present form will be obtained.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            No body of theoretical
explanation emerges from a social or cultural vacuum.  Nor did what is here
identified as the American contribution emerge from a spontaneous flash of
insight on the part of its developers.  It is a part of the social process as
that process has been carried on in the half-continent of the United States
during the last 450 years.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            What are the cultural
origins of American heterodox social thought?  How can we account for the
development and unique character of American heterodoxy?  What are the unifying
ideas of the American civilization of which the American contribution is an
expression?  These are the kinds of questions which require answers at this
juncture of the present study.</p>

<p class=Body align=center style='text-align:center'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body align=center style='text-align:center'>II</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            While the effort to
explain that which is unique about the American culture has taken a variety of
forms, there is remarkable agreement among the contemporary interpreters of
this experience regarding the general substance and significance of this
American development.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Henry Bamford Parkes sees
the “freedom enjoyed by individual members” as the distinguishing attribute of
the American experience.  This freedom has been obtained, says Parkes, through
an early and consistent effort (until the 20th century) to realize “agrarian
democracy” as the unifying principle of American social organization.”<a

class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[325]</span></span></span></a>
</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            For Ralph Barton Perry the
development of the American culture in its literally peculiar character is best
identified by the idea of “individualism.”</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            If one were limited to a
single word with which to characterize America, one</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            would choose the word
“individualism”--used, however, with reservations.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            If individualism is taken
to mean the cult of solitude, or the prizing of </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            those personal traits
which set one man apart from his fellows, or are the</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            effect of retreat from the
world, then no word could be less appropriate.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            American individuality is
the very opposite of singularity.  The people of the</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            United States are highly
gregarious and sociable.  The individual who holds</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            himself apart, who will
not “join,” who does not “belong,” who will not “get</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            together” and “play the
game,” who does not “row his weight in the boat,” is</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            viewed with suspicion. 
Americans find silence hard to endure, and if they</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            develop an oddity they
make a fad of it so that they may dwell among</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            similar oddities.  Their
individualism is a<i> collective</i> individualism--not the</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            isolation of one human
being, but the intercourse and cooperation of many.<a href="#_ftn326"
name="_ftnref326" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[326]</span></span></span></a> </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The capacity of the
American to alter his inherited ways of behaving is the major content of the
“American Character” according to Denis W. Brogan.  “Adaptation ... was the
key.”</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            A family or an individual
had to have what it took to survive--and it took adapt-</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            ability, toughness,
perhaps a not-too-sensitive moral or social outlook.  The</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            would-be profit-drawers in
England simply contributed capital on which no      </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            return was or could be
made.  The would-be gentry unlearned the idle les-</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            sons of gentility or sank
into poverty or returned to the easier world they had</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            left.  From the beginning
it was “root, hog, or die.”  and the American razor-</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            back hog that the forest
bred, with little meat and much muscle, was a symbol</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            as well as a product of
adaptation.<a href="#_ftn327" name="_ftnref327" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[327]</span></span></span></a> </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Confidence in “the ability
of human nature to respond to a fair chance” constitutes an essential part of
The Promise of American Life says Herbert Croly.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The theory of the American
democracy and its practice was proclaimed to</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            be the antithesis of ...
European theory and practice.  The people were to be</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            trusted rather than
suspected and disciplined.  They must be tied to their</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            country by the strong bond
of self-interest.  Give them a fair chance, and the</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            natural goodness of human
nature would do the rest.  Individual and public</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            interest will, on the
whole, coincide, provided no individuals are allowed to </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            have special privileges. 
Thus the American system will be predestined to</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            success by its own
adequacy, and its success will constitute an enormous</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            stride towards human
amelioration.  Just because our system is at bottom </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            a thorough test of the
ability of human nature to respond admirably to a fair</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            chance, the issue of the
experiment is bound to be of more than national</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            importance.  The American
system stands for the highest hope of an excel-</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            lent worldly life that
mankind has yet ventured, the hope that men can be</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            improved without being
fettered, that they can be saved without even</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            vicariously being nailed
to the cross.<a href="#_ftn328" name="_ftnref328" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[328]</span></span></span></a> </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            “The existence of an area
of free land, its continuous recession, and the advance of American settlement
westward, explain American development,” says Frederick Jackson Turner.  This,
the “Turner Thesis” regarding the role of the frontier in American history,
finds the peculiarity of American culture in the requirements of successive
adjustment of institutional structure.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The peculiarity of
American institutions is the fact that they have been com-</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            pelled to adapt themselves
to the changes of an expanding people--to the</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            changes involved in
crossing a continent, in winning a wilderness, and in</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            developing at each area of
this progress out of the primitive economic and </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            political conditions of
the frontier into the complexity of city life.  Said Calhoun</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            in 1817, “We are great,
and rapidly--I was about to say fearfully--growing!”  So</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            saying, he touched the
distinguishing feature of American life.<a href="#_ftn329" name="_ftnref329"
title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[329]</span></span></span></a> </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Henry Steele Commager
finds that as a consequence of the material character of his culture, the
American has a “quantitative cast to his thinking” and is “inclined to place a
quantitative valuation upon almost everything.”<a href="#_ftn330"
name="_ftnref330" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[330]</span></span></span></a>   The
“quantitative cast” of mind provides the American with something of a unique
habitual mode of making judgments; the American is a “practical” man.  Says
Commager:</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            This quantitative cast of
American thought was an indication of an intense</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            practicality which
extended to most, though by no means all, matters.  Often</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            romantic about business,
the American was practical about politics, religion,</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            culture, and science.  He
was endlessly ingenious and resourceful, always</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            ready to improvise new
tools or techniques to meet new conditions.  “A</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            plaine souldier that can
use a pick-axe and a spade,” Captain John Smith </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            had discovered, “is better
than five knights,” and on every successive frontier</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            that discovery was the
price of survival.  The American borrowed readily from</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Indian or immigrant and
naturalized what he borrowed; he improvised</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            jauntily, had little
respect for custom, and was willing to try anything.  His</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            reaction to most
situations was a practical one, and he was happiest when</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            he could find a mechanical
solution to problems: the cotton gin, the steam</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            boat, the harvester, the
six-shooter, the sewing machine, vulcanized  rubber,</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            the telegraph and
telephone, barbed-wire fencing, the typewriter, and a</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            thousand other inventions
anticipated the day when the American was to be</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            notorious for his passion
for gadgets.  He was among the first to concede</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            to technology a place in
higher education ...<a href="#_ftn331" name="_ftnref331" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[331]</span></span></span></a> </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            When the essential content
is abstracted from the statements and quotations above, there emerges a triad
of ideas in terms of which that which is most unique about the American
experience can be expressed.  These three ideas are: 1) the idea of social
fluidity, of adjustment of institutions in response to new problems; 2) the
idea of democracy, of a society in which ungraded men have control over social
policy and institutional modification; and 3) the idea of “practical”
judgments, of judgments seeking to apply what has been learned regarding new
instruments and techniques to the problems at hand.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The significance of the
“practical” judgment in the developing American experience is illustrated in
the following passage.  A failure to apply such matter-of-fact judgments was
frequently catastrophic.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Adaptation ... was the
key.  How many early settlements ... withered away or</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            were swept away by famine
and disease!  To pick the wrong, malarial,</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            snake-infested, swampy
site for the settlement, that was a mistake paid</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            for by the loss of the
meager capital resources so painfully accumulated--</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            and often by the forfeit
of life as well.  To fail to plant the right crops at the</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            right time was mistake as
deadly.  The early settlers of New England bore</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            in their memories the duty
of gratitude to the Indians who taught them the</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            completely novel technique
of planting Indian corn (maize), the making of </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            the little mound like a
golf-tee, the use of fish as a fertilizer--ways so new</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            to wheat-growers, to users
of plows and breeders of cattle.  The timing of</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            your arrival on the
American coast ... might mean death for all or most of</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            the party before the first
crops could be harvested.<a href="#_ftn332" name="_ftnref332" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[332]</span></span></span></a> </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            That this literally
peculiar character of American experience was a product of the interplay of
inheritance and environment, of the Old World and the New World, is commonly
acknowledged.  The development of any new culture is necessarily of this
character.  But to explain why this interplay should have produced a culture
characterized by the triad of ideas mentioned above requires further analysis.</p>

<p class=Body align=center style='text-align:center'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body align=center style='text-align:center'>III</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Perhaps the most obvious
fact to be kept in mind regarding the early history of America is that what is
now the United States was settled during the course of 450 years by the largest
mass migration of people in recent human history.  Somewhere between fifty and
sixty million people “pulled up stakes” in Europe and migrated to the two
Americas.  They brought European ideas, European techniques, and European
physical habits.  They settled in the course of the last 300 years an area of
some three million square miles inhabited by some few thousand nomadic
Indians.  They found the country rich in natural resources as defined by the
then-current state of the industrial arts.  Moreover, and perhaps most
important of all, they found no well-organized, highly structured society
already in occupation.  For example, not one acre of the new land was privately
owned when the Europeans arrived.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            This conjuncture of
circumstance provided the European settlers with an unparalleled opportunity
and, concurrently, with perhaps unparalleled problems of social and
technological innovation.  Says Brogan:</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            They have brought these
[European ideas and techniques] to an empty</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            continent and it has taken
them centuries not merely to fill that continent, </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            but to create ways of life
adapted to a different climate, to a different set  of</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            economic possibilities,
and to a society held together at its beginnings by</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            imported political and
social habits, and only slowly and with repeated crises</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            creating American
political and social habits to replace the European</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            importations that, with
each decade, wore thinner and thinner like an old </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            carpet.  In this process
the modern American has been created ...<a href="#_ftn333" name="_ftnref333"
title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[333]</span></span></span></a> </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>By virtue of the character of the
problems encountered as well as the attitudes of mind which occasioned the
migrations, the American settlers produced a society different in kind from
that from which they had come.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            It is commonly acknowledge
that America was settled by heretics and dissenters of all kinds.<a
href="#_ftn334" name="_ftnref334" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[334]</span></span></span></a>  
Some were persons seeking to pursue unpopular religious beliefs; some were
seeking more effective participation in the economic process; some were
political refugees from the machinations of their respective European
communities.  That is to say, the mass migration to the American continent was
fundamentally motivated by a desire to exercise discretion in areas where such
discretion was not tolerable to the established power-systems in the cultures
of Europe.  The character of the divergency between the European order and that
developed in America has been perhaps nowhere better stated than in the
following statement:</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The European mind had been
dominated by a hierarchical sense of order.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            This sense was embodied
most completely in the philosophical and poli-</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            tical theory of the Middle
Ages; but even after the breakdown of feudalism </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            and the repudiation of the
scholastic philosophy, it continued, in one form </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            or another, to permeate
the consciousness of most Europeans.<a href="#_ftn335" name="_ftnref335"
title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[335]</span></span></span></a>  
Human</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            society was regarded as
the reflection of an ideal order derived from the</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            will of God and fully
embodied in the cosmos.  And the life of  the individual</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            acquired meaning and value
insofar as he conformed with the order of the</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            society to which he
belonged ...<a href="#_ftn336" name="_ftnref336" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[336]</span></span></span></a> </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The fate of these ideas
when they were imported into America was as follows, continues Parkes:</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The first immigrants to
America brought with them this sense of order,</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            but in the American world
it gradually grew weaker; it did not remain a</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            permanent part of the
American consciousness.  Coming to a country</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>             where there was no
elaborate social organization, and where the</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            individual must constantly
do battle with the forces of nature, the American</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            came to see life not as an
attempt to realize an ideal order, but as a struggle</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            between the human will and
the environment ...</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>                 The most obvious
result of this American attitude was the fostering of an</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            extraordinary energy and
confidence of will.  The American came to believe</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            that nothing was beyond
his power to accomplish, provided that he could</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            muster the necessary moral
and material resources, and that any obstacle</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            could be mastered by means
of the appropriate methods and technology.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            A failure was the result
either of weakness or on an incorrect technique ...<a href="#_ftn337"
name="_ftnref337" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[337]</span></span></span></a> </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            “Rejecting both the belief
in a fixed social order and the belief in the depravity of human beings,”
concludes Parkes,</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            the American created a
society whose special characteristic was the</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            freedom enjoyed by its
individual menders.  Respect for the freedom</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            of every individual and
confidence that he would use his freedom wisely</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            and constructively became
the formative principles of the new American </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            nationality.  By crossing
the Atlantic, the American had asserted a demand</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            to be himself; he had
repudiated the disciplines of the class hierarchy, of</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            long-established
tradition, and of authoritarian religion.  And in the society</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            that took shape in the New
World it was by his natural and inherent quality</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            that the individual was
measured, rather than by rank or status or conformity</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            to convention.  To a much
greater degree than elsewhere, society in America</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            was based on the natural
man rather than on man as molded by social</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            rituals and restraints. 
The mores of America were less rigid and less</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            formalized than those of
any earlier community, and the individual was less</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            inhibited.  The American
did not believe that men needed to be coerced,</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            intimidated, or
indoctrinated into good behavior.<a href="#_ftn338" name="_ftnref338" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Despite the Rousseauian
flavor of the idea of “natural man” inhibited by social restraints, the content
of Professor Parkes’ remarks is essentially correct.  In America there
developed a society of essentially ungraded men--a society in which the
important questions are “what do you know,” and “what can you <u>do</u>;” not
“who is your father,” or “why did you deviate?”</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Americans have confidence
in the constructive potentialities of human nature because they very early
developed experiential evidence that such confidence was rewarded with
effective social participation.  Americans understand that the release of human
energies in response to a never-ending array of crucial social problems
provides effective means for the resolution of such problems.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            It thus becomes apparent
that whatever is literally unique about the American culture is primarily a
consequence of the character of the American experience.  The ideas of social
fluidity, of democracy, and of “practical” judgments emerge as a consequence of
the American experience with a 300 year physical frontier.  These three ideas
emerge from the frontier in a causal sense and are best illustrated perhaps by
this frontier experience.</p>

<p class=Body align=center style='text-align:center'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body align=center style='text-align:center'>IV</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The phrase “root, hog, or
die” aptly suggests the essential content of frontier existence.  Modification
of European habits of social organization and technique <i>had</i> to occur if
the mere continuity of life  was to be maintained on the frontier.  The crucial
judgments on a frontier <i>must</i> be made in view of and in terms of the
physical and social determinants of the problems confronted.  To judge
otherwise was to invite literal disaster.  And disaster was the eventuation for
those who insisted on the maintenance of previously conditioned mores and
techniques in the face of evidence of their demonstrated inapplicability and,
therefore, of their obvious unfitness for the problems at hand.  A failure to
comprehend was an invitation to defeat.  Defeat was frequent but the community
profited in a comprehension sense from the mistakes of its members.  Further
modification and adjustment followed incorporation of such enhanced
comprehension.  Error was corrected.  And the problems of survival encountered
on the frontier responded to the application of the “practical” judgment.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The literature regarding
the frontier is replete with instances in which the accepted canons of “proper”
conduct were necessarily set aside to permit the application of know-how and
techniques which “fitted” in a demonstrable sense.<a href="#_ftn339"
name="_ftnref339" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[339]</span></span></span></a>  
Military rank frequently became subservient to the frontier scout’s knowledge
of the nature of the terrain and of the predictable behavior of the Indian
tribes.  Canons of decency regarding the aversion to animal waste were set aside
in the Platte Valley when wagon trains to Oregon required fuel to prepare the
necessary meals enroute.  In the absence of adequate wood supplies, buffalo
“chips” were used for fuel.  Comprehension of applicable technique was the
condition of survival.  Says Walter Prescott Webb,</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            To the white man, with his
forest culture, the Plains presented themselves as</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            an obstacle, one which
served to exercise and often defeat his ingenuity, to</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            upset his calculations, to
hinder his settlement, and to alter his weapons, </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            tools, institutions, and
social attitudes; in short, to throw his whole way of life</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            out of gear.  The history
of the white man in the Great Plains is the history of</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            adjustments and
modifications, of giving up old things that would no longer</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            function for new things
that would, of giving up an old way of life for a new way</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            in order that there might
be<u> a</u> way ...<a href="#_ftn340" name="_ftnref340" title=""><span

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Among the innovations
analyzed by Webb in his discussion of the character of the settlement of the
Great Plains are the following: 1) the abandonment of river travel for
transport by horse and caravan; 2) the invention and use of the six-shooter as
an instrument of war for the mounted plainsman; 3) the innovation of handling
cattle on horseback; 4) the development and use of barbed wire as a fencing
material in place of the split wooden rail; 5) the introduction of the windmill
in providing water in semi-arid regions; 6) the adaptation of irrigation
techniques which required modification in the English Common Law regarding
water rights; 7) the development of dry farming techniques with the concomitant
requirement of modification of traditional attitudes regarding land unit size;
and 8) political innovation, expressing itself in such vagaries as populism,
agrarian crusades, and farm relief.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            In frontier communities,
it was soon discovered that such comprehension was shared by all in some
degree.  That the collective judgment of persons who had themselves encountered
and solved frontier problems was apt to be superior to that of an individual
was an increasingly recognized principle.  Thus the frontier was a
democratizing influence.  Considerations of prestige, rank, status, and family
background were irrelevant to the problems of survival.  The pertinent
questions were: What can you do?  What skills do you have?  What do you know
about military defense against Indians, fording a stream with a Conestoga wagon
and a team of oxen, erecting a sod shelter where wood is not plentiful enough
for log cabins, educating children in the elements of literacy, aiding as a
midwife at the birth of children, and leading men not on the basis of
autocratic discipline but in such fashion so as to permit the maximal effective
contribution of each member of the group?</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Professor Perry has
identified the concept of democracy as follows: “The basic ideal which gives to
the word ‘democracy’ its original and latent meaning is the idea of a social
group organized and directed by all of its members for the benefit of all of
its members.”<a href="#_ftn341" name="_ftnref341" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[341]</span></span></span></a>   The frontier imposed
conditions which made survival contingent on some significant approximation of
this idea of democracy.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Among the leading and
original exponents of the democratizing impact of the frontier on human
organization was Federick Jackson Turner.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Turner’s explanation for
the uniqueness of American democracy was the</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            existence of the
frontier.  For this young adventurer in history, the frontier was</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            neither a place nor a
state of mind.  It was an evolution.  From the first 17th</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            century settlements to
near the end of the 19th century American society had</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            always been starting
afresh in new wilderness areas, and in each new place</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            had developed swiftly from
simplicity to complexity.  “What the Mediterran-</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            ean Sea was to the Greeks,
breaking the bond of custom, offering new</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            experiences, calling out
new institutions and activities,” said Turner in 1891,</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            “that the ever-retreating
Great West has been to the eastern United States</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            directly, and to the
nations of Europe more remotely.” “The most important</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            effect of the frontier,”
said Turner in his famous paper at Chicago in 1893, </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            “has been the promotion of
democracy here and in Europe.”  “American</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            democracy,” he reiterated
in 1914 in much quoted phrases, “was born of no</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            theorist’s dream: it was
not carried in the <u>Susan Constant</u> to Virginia nor in</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            the <u>Mayflower</u> to
Plymouth.  It came out of the American forest, and it gained</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            strength each time it
touched a new frontier.”  Democracy, therefore, had a</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            unique origin in America.<a

</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The nondiscriminatory
aspects of frontier life, the compulsions under such circumstances to an
equalitarian treatment of individuals, has been ably set forth by Professor
Paxon:</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Youth, poverty, and hope
in an environment of grinding labor were the con-</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            stituents of the frontier
mind; and there have been few situations in which</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            more has depended upon the
physical and individual stamina of the man,</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            and less upon the
accidents of his possessions.  Birth had very little to do </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            with success upon the
border.  It did not make the axe more sharp or the </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            sod less tough.  Education
had little to do with it.  Persistent physical labor </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            was the lot of the
able-bodied man or woman.  There were few moments </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            for intellectual
relaxation; and although the wise and prudent lived longer </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            than the foolish, the
processes of establishment were the same for all.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Wealth had less to do with
success than in most society, for there were</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            few stores in which to
buy; few things to sell; and almost no labour to be </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            hired.  There were few
uses for money that gave an advantage to the man </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            who had it, where every
man was working for himself, and where the labours </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            of the pioneer filled
every hour of daylight.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>                 In a world of unusual
equalities there developed readily an equalitar-</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            ianism of thought.  Upon
the border there was a democracy of fact ....  By</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            observation the
frontiersman saw that his neighbour was no better than</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            himself; and he resented
keenly the assumption by another of superiority.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            His democracy of<u> fact</u>
made him resent the emergence of any privileged</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            class, and made him
restive under the thumb of any party, or local govern-</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            ment, or nation that
sought to impress itself upon his life without his full</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            concurrence.<a

</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            While the frontier
experience has long been eulogized as the seedbed of “rugged individualism,”
such eulogies frequently misconceive the character of the individualism on the
frontier.  It was not a circumstance in which men found themselves unrestrained
and uninhibited by any social restraints or controls.  It was a circumstance in
which the establishment of such controls could be tailored in such fashion as
to permit the exercise of “practical” judgments in carrying on the necessary
economic and social functions.  And this job of cutting the institutional
“cloth” to fit the actual problems encountered could best be accomplished when
those involved in the problem had a voice in the shaping of the proposed
adjustment.  Self-reliance was not an atomistic phenomenon; it was a
consequence of the recognition that shared judgment and mutual determination
permitted all to do what was otherwise impossible on a strictly individual
basis.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            American self-reliance is
a plural, collective, self-reliance--not ”I can,” but </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            “<u>we</u> can.”  But it
is still individualistic--a togetherness of several and not </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            the isolation of one, or
the absorption of all into a higher unity.  The appro-</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            priate term is not
“organism” but “organization;” <u>ad hoc</u> organization, extem-</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            porized to meet
emergencies, and multiple organization in which the same</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            individuals join many and
surrender themselves to none.  Americans do not</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            take naturally to
mechanized discipline.  They remain an aggregate of</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            spontaneities.  Such
organization develops and uses temporary leaders--</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            “natural” leaders, and
leaders for the business in hand, rather than</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            established authorities.<a
href="#_ftn344" name="_ftnref344" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[344]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Thus we see that the triad
of ideas which have here been described as those which are most
characteristically American are in fact closely interrelated and
interdependent.  The idea of democracy <i>means</i> that the persons who
receive the incidence of social policy are themselves the ones who have
discretion over the determination and administration of that policy. 
Progressive modification of social policy means progressive adjustment of
institutional structure, social fluidity.  And where the community-at-large has
such discretion it will most frequently act in terms of its maturest
comprehension of the nature of the determinants of the existent problems, it
will apply its collective “practical” judgment.  The fact that America
experienced a physical frontier for such a large portion of its historical
development means that these ideas found continuous, developmental application
and were a source of irritation to the defenders of the status quo at all
stages in American history.  From the frontiers, these ideas permeated the
remainer of the culture, altering modifying, condition, and prescribing the
course of its development.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            These ideas have not found
universal acceptance even in America.  Contrary tendencies have developed and
will continue to develop.  But the fact remains that the American culture, more
than any other culture in human history, has been the living embodiment of the
essence of these ideas.  For most of the period of the American development, these
ideas were largely inarticulate.  But articulate or not, their significance
cannot be ignored.  There<i> is</i> something unique in a literal sense about
the American experience.  Note the following selection:</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Americanism is not a
static thing, crystallized by habit, custom, authority, and</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            dogma, but a broad and
flexible purpose which is adaptable to altered con-</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            ditions, and which moves
to new frontiers when old frontiers have been left</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            behind.  The belief, the
will, the faith which is American is no worship of the</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            past, no assurance that
all is perfect in the eternal constitution of things, or in </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            another world, but a
conditional faith: <u>we can if we try</u>, and put our minds and</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            our hand to it, and unite
our action.  It is not an easy optimism--a faith that</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            moves mountains by simply
wishing and believing, or by invoking super-</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            natural agencies, but an
inventive optimism, which moves mountains by</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            learning how and applying
the necessary leverage.  It is utopian in its dreams,</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            but does not confuse
dreams with the actual state of affairs, and is prepared</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            to earn rewards and not
have them handed out.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>                 This faith is
justified to Americans by the fact that mountains <u>have</u> been</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            moved.  This faith, like
all faith, exceeds the limits of past experience, but only</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            because past experience
itself has proved the immense resources of the</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            implemented human will. 
It is a faith which does not easily accept impos-</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            sibilities because so many
impossibilities have proved to be possible.  It is</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            a faith, therefore, which
is peculiarly suited to change: welcoming change both</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            as affording an
opportunity of advance, and as requiring new moves with </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            which to meet those of the
evil adversary.  Americanism is not dismayed by</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            the uncertainty of the
future, or by the surprises of the perpetually unfolding</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            present.<a href="#_ftn345"

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            This quotation means that
the idea of “faith” has a uniquely American connotation.  It is a “faith” in
the capacities of the human intellect to resolve human problems when that
intellect is encouraged to develop to its most complete level.</p>

<p class=Body align=center style='text-align:center'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body align=center style='text-align:center'>V</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The social scientists’
effort to articulate the essentially unique quality of the American experience
has been a long and frequently tortuous effort.  But the function of explaining
to a culture the character of its experiences and the meaning of such
experience has always been the task of the more literate members of the
community.  And the fact that for a considerable number of decades the
explanations of the American experience frequently missed the mark of
accounting for the unique character of that experience increased the necessity
for continuous efforts in that direction.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The American culture has
been described frequently as a community that talks one way and acts another. 
In some fashion or other, the proffered explanations of the development of the
American in terms of “manifest destiny,” and “the pursuit of happiness” did not
quite ring true.  There was a disjunction between behavioral traits and
judgments on the one hand, and the idea systems in terms of which behavior and
judgments were analyzed and explained on the other.  The fact of the
disjunction lends credence to the assertion of a literally unique quality about
the American experience.  Such experience did not fit the traditional
explanations of social development.  What is here captioned the American
contribution is the most inclusive and scientific explanations purporting to
bring the theory of American development into greater correspondence with the
run of the evidences of that development.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Just as the peculiar
character of the American<i> experience</i> is a product of a European culture
transplanted and severely modified by the exigencies of a 300 year physical
frontier, so also is the development of articulate American social theorizing a
product of the inherited and imported thought systems and the indigenous
contributions of American scholars.  The latter product is generically,
historically, and intellectually related to the former product.  And the latter
product is, in its own way, as literally unique as is the former product.  It
is the function of the remainder of this chapter to elucidate the particular
cultural and intellectual origins from which the writings of Thorstein Veblen,
John Dewey, and Clarence Ayres emerge.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body align=center style='text-align:center'>VI</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The cultural context out of
which emerge the heterodox theories of these American scholars is, of course,
that of the post-Civil War America.  With the close of that conflict, the way
was opened for the advent of industrial capitalism.  Nowhere in the world,
perhaps, were the institutions of capitalism to be given a comparably
consistent trial-run.  The defeat of the Southern aristocracy and the rise to
power of the Republican party constituted a shift in the locus of political
power.  Within the next thirty years, after 1865, the remaining frontier was
brought within the confines of an integrated economy.  The battles over
agrarianism continued well into the 20th century, but the shift in political
power, and therefore economic power, at the close of the Civil War gave
forewarning of the character of the eventual outcome.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Barbed wire, the windmill,
and the six-shooter had facilitated the settlement of the last frontier, the
Great Plains.  Iron rails rapidly bound the agrarian economy of the West with
that of the industrial East.  The Bessemer process transformed an age of iron
into an age of steel.  And the application of scientific insight kept apace in
the development of mechanized agricultural techniques.  Exploitation of
resources through competent techniques became the accepted behavioral trait. 
It was the period of “The Great Barbecue,” as Parrington captioned this portion
of the Gilded Age.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            This bustling America of
1870 accounted itself a democratic world.  A free</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            people had put away all
aristocratic privileges and conscious of  its power</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            went forth to possess the
last frontier.  Its social philosophy, which it found </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            adequate to its needs, was
summed up in three words--preemption, exploita-</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            government of its rich
holdings.  Lands in the possession of the government</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Before the age of
industrialism in America was a quarter of a century old, rumblings of dissent
began to be heard.  Unlovely manifestations of the effort to apply capitalistic
theory to the problems of the economy began early to make themselves apparent. 
The farmers’ Granger movement of the 1870s was a response to the predatory
behavior of the railroad barons.  The rumbling of dissent were also manifest in
the early, if abortive, efforts to organize the Knights of Labor as a
significant labor movement.  Much of the agitation for social reform in terms
of “easy money policies,” “anti-monopoly proposals,” and the like were embodied
in third party movements.  The Populist Party reached the height of its power
just before the turn of the century.  The cultural matrix of the development of
American heterodoxy constituted the forcing bed for the articulation of
explanations of the nature of the American experiment in social
problem-solving.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body align=center style='text-align:center'>VII</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Post-Civil War America
also provided a modified intellectual matrix from which emerged social
heterodox thought.  Says Parrington:</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The enthronement of the
machine was only the outward and visible sign of</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            the revolution in thought
that came with the rise of science.  As a new cosmos</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            unfolded before the
inquisitive eyes of scientists, the old metaphysical</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            speculations became as
obsolete as the old household economy.  A new</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            spirit of realism was
abroad, probing and questioning the material world,</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            pushing the realm of exact
knowledge into the earlier regions of faith.  The</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            conquest of nature was the
great business of the day, and as that conquest</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            went forward triumphantly
the solid fruits of the new mastery were gathered</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            by industrialism.  Science
and the machine were the twin instruments for</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            creating a new
civilization, of which the technologist and the industrialist</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            were the high priests. 
The transcendental theologian was soon to be as</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            extinct as the passenger
pigeon.<a href="#_ftn347" name="_ftnref347" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span

</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The “revolution in
thought” which occurred was causally influenced and perhaps best illustrated by
the publication in America in 1860 of Charles Darwin's <u>Origin of Species</u>. 
This book was an appropriate symbol of the character of the forthcoming
modifications in social analysis.<a href="#_ftn348" name="_ftnref348" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[348]</span></span></span></a> </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The impact of Darwin’s
work on the natural and social sciences, as well as upon theological beliefs,
was admittedly enormous.  It was a fundamental shift in attitudes of mind
regarding the inquiry process.  Says John Dewey:</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            That the publication of
the “Origin of Species” marked an epoch in the dev-</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            elopment of the natural
sciences is well known to the layman.  That the</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            combination of the very
words origin and species embodied an intellect-</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            ual revolt and introduced
a new intellectual temper is easily overlooked by</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            the expert.  The
conceptions that had reigned in the philosophy of nature</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            and knowledge for 2000
years, the conceptions that had become the familiar</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            furniture of the mind,
rested on the assumption of the superiority of the fixed</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            and final; they rested
upon treating change and origin as signs of defect and</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            unreality.  In laying
hands upon the sacred ark of absolute permanency, in</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            treating the forms that
had been regarded as types of fixity and perfection as</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            originating and passing
away, the “Origin of Species” introduced a mode of</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            thinking that in the end
was bound to transform the logic of knowledge, and</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            hence the treatment of
morals, politics, and religion.<a href="#_ftn349" name="_ftnref349" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[349]</span></span></span></a> </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>And while the Darwinian controversy
was customarily viewed as the encroachment of science on theology, its more
significant impact was the transformation of the nature of scientific inquiry. 
The effect on science was to transform such inquiry from a search for reality
behind and beyond the processes of nature to a search for reality <i>within </i>the
processes of nature.  As Dewey puts it:</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            There are, indeed, but two
alternative courses.  We must either find the</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            appropriate objects and
organs of knowledge in the mutual interactions of</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            changing things; or else,
to escape the infection of change, we <u>must</u> seek</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            them in some transcendent
and supernal region.  The human mind, delib-</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            erately as it were,
exhausted the logic of the changeless, the final, and the</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            transcendent, before it
assayed adventure on the pathless wastes of gen-</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            eration and transformation.<a

</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            And there is, perhaps, no
better summarization of the impact of Darwinian ideas than a further statement
by Dewey:</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The influence of Darwin
upon philosophy resides in his having conquered the</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            phenomena of life for the
principle of transition, and thereby freed the new</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            logic for application to
mind and morals and life.  When he said of species</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            what Galileo had said of
the earth, <u>e pur se muove</u>, he emancipated, once </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            and for all, genetic and
experimental ideas as an organon of asking quest-</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            ions and looking for
explanations.<a href="#_ftn351" name="_ftnref351" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            It was, of course, Herbert
Spencer who first popularized the evolutionary outlook among social scientists
in the United States and England.  And while persons like Dewey and Veblen
objected to the particular analysis of Spencer regarding the social
significance of Darwinism, both accepted the evolutionary point of view.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The impact of Darwinism
stirred the intellectual temper of the times.  But there were other
philosophical influences in the last quarter of the 19th century which
contributed to the development of heterodoxy in social analysis.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Both Dewey and Veblen were
strongly influenced in their formal educational training by German philosophy. 
Indeed, the importation of Hegelian Idealism and Kantianism was viewed as a
threat to the orthodoxy of British Empiricism and the Scottish common-sense
philosophy.  Hegel’s concept of “becoming” had been offered as a partial
refutation of the Newtonian concept of “being.”  And this placed hegelianism in
conflict with the British Empirical school, especially the philosophy of John
Stuart Mill.  Hegelianism was process or evolutionary analysis.  Marx had
adopted the Hegelian dialectic, with important modifications, and Marxian ideas
circulated widely in America and England during this period.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Dewey has acknowledged the
important impact that Hegelianism had upon the formative years of his
intellectual development.  It left a “permanent deposit” in Dewey’s thinking. 
The nature of the deposit is revealed in the following selection:</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Hegel’ idea of cultural
institutions as an “objective mind” upon which indi-</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            viduals were dependent in
the formation of their mental life fell in with the</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            influence of Comte and of
Condorcet and Bacon.  The metaphysical idea</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            that an absolute mind is
manifested in social institutions dropped out; the </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            idea, upon an empirical
basis, of the power exercised by cultural environ-</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            ment in shaping the ideas,
beliefs, and intellectual attitudes of individuals</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            remained.  It was a factor
in producing my belief that the not uncommon</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            assumption in both
psychology and philosophy of a ready-made mind over</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            against a physical world
as an object has no empirical support.  It was a</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            factor in producing my
belief that the only possible psychology, as distinct </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            from a biological account
of behavior, is a social psychology.  With respect</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            to more technically
philosophical matters, the Hegelian emphasis upon</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            continuity and the
function of conflict persisted on empirical grounds after </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            my earlier confidence in
dialectic had given way to skepticism.  There was</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            a period extending into my
earlier years at Chicago when, in connection</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            with a seminar in Hegel’s
logic I tried reinterpreting his categories in terms </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            of “readjustment” and
“reconstruction.”  Gradually I came to realize that what</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            the principles actually
stood for could be better understood and stated when</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            completely emancipated
from Hegelian garb.<a href="#_ftn352" name="_ftnref352" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[352]</span></span></span></a> </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>Much of the Hegelian influence upon
Dewey’s thought was a consequence of his long and intimate association with
George Sylverster Morris.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Veblen’s interests were
directed to the works of Kant.  At Yale, Veblen did research in Kantian
philosophy.  Noah Porter at Yale was Veblen’s major instructor in philosophy
and was also his intellectual confidant.  Veblen’s doctoral dissertation,
“Ethical Grounds of a Doctrine of Retribution,” involved a thorough-going
treatment of both Spencer and Kant.<a href="#_ftn353" name="_ftnref353" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Porter represented
substantially the common-sense philosophy, with its</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            utilitarian ethics and its
apotheosis of the rights of property.  Porter, Sumner,</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            and Spencer were
essentially of the same school ....  But Veblen specialized</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            in Kant and the
post-Kantians.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>                 Kant was of a
different mould.  His ethics was not hedonistic.<a href="#_ftn354"
name="_ftnref354" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[354]</span></span></span></a> </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'> </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>Kant’s “categorical imperative” was a
moral imperative which “recognizes that man is an end in himself, not a means,
but it is not therefore utilitarian, for utilitarianism is not moral.”<a

</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Veblen took from Kant the
idea of the significance of the power of inductive reasoning as an indispensable
component of morality.  Indeed, Veblen published an article on Kant’s <u>Critique
of Judgment</u>.<a href="#_ftn356" name="_ftnref356" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[356]</span></span></span></a>   He held that <u>The
Critique of Judgment</u> was “an attempt to mediate between the outcome of the <u>Critique
of Pure Reason</u>, ‘which is the notion of strict determinism, according to
natural law, in the world,’ and the <u>Critique of Practical Reason</u>, ‘which
is the notion of freedom in the person ...<a href="#_ftn357" name="_ftnref357"

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            From Kant, Veblen
apparently obtained a refinement of his theory of knowledge--a refinement in
the nature and significance of inductive reasoning.  Moreover, it was an
insight into the fact that intuitive and revealed theories of knowledge were
not applicable to real problems.  Kant supplied Veblen with ideas which helped
him formulate a non-absolute, non-final, non-teleological explanation of the
nature of knowledge.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            But though this question
of teleology is of extreme importance, yet a know-</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            ledge of the teleological

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            event as considered from

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            not  absolutely necessary
in order to human life, nor even in order to a high</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            degree of development in
moral life.  In truth, a knowledge of ultimate</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            particular ends and
purposes is of no use whatever in the affairs of everyday</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            life; and, therefore, the
principle of teleology, as being the principle of con-</p>

world, is not indispensable in order to such know-</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            logical application,
consisted in the decision of teleological questions</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            alone, its value would be
small enough.  Such, however, is not the case.<a href="#_ftn358"

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Not only were Dewey and
Veblen influenced by the consideration of Germanic philosophy, they were
markedly attracted to the thinking of an obscure logician at Johns Hopkins by
the name of Charles Saunders Peirce.  Professor Dorfman records Veblen’s
contact with Peirce in the following passage:</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Veblen became interest in
the lectures on “Elementary Logic” given by a</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            man who was later to be
recognised as a creative intellectual force.  This</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            was Charles Peirce, a
temporary lecturer.  Peirce had already published a </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            series of papers on “The
Logic of Science,” emphasizing that “the whole</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            function of thought is to
produce habits of action,” that the “guiding principles”</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            of inquiry are “habits of
mind,” that “thought is an <u>action</u>” leading in turn to</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            further thought.  He
marked a radical departure from the “method of authority”</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            of common sense.  He
described Mill’s classic <u>Logic</u> as embodying the</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            “philosophy of ordinary
mankind,” but declared that most of the examples of</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            scientific induction in
the first edition of the <u>Logic</u> had since been proven to</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Stanley M. Daugert has
suggested an integration of the influence of Kant and Peirce on the development
of Veblen’s theory of knowledge.  says Daugert:</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            ... in these four points
of interpretation of Kant’s epistemology lie the source</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            of much that is
distinctive and characteristic in Veblen’s later economic</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            philosophy.  These points
are as follows:  Veblen 1) identified Kant’s faculty </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            of the pure reflective
judgment with inductive reasoning; 2) sought to extend</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            the reflective judgment as

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>The seeds of what will be developed
below in this study as Dewey's “instrumental logic” are to be found in the
writings of Charles Saunders Peirce.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            A further intellectual
influence on Veblen as reflected in the character of the ideas which he
produced is that of cultural anthropology.  Veblen early took an interest in
the work of the anthropologists and sociologists.  And while much of the early
literature of the scholars in this field reflected the Spencerian application
of Darwinism to social analysis, Veblen avoided, for the most part, this
“survival of the fittest” point of view.<a href="#_ftn364" name="_ftnref364"
title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[364]</span></span></span></a> </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Veblen’s interest in
anthropological inquiry stemmed from his concern to explain the evolutionary
development of human institutions, and especially economic institutions.  When
Veblen was at the University of Chicago, a friend--W.I. Thomas of the sociology
department--was expressing skepticism of the Spencerian approach to an
explanation of culture.  Dorfman quotes Thomas as follows:</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            “[Anthropology] ... has
undergone a change well illustrated by the difference</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            between the biological
botany of today, and the ‘herbarium’ botany of the past.”</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Today the primary interest
is in “the laws of growth,” the laws of development</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            within a culture, not in
classification.  Thomas worked in terms of Loeb’s</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            tropisms, but interpreted
them in a manner more akin to Morgan’s and</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Dewey’s psychology and
philosophy than to Loeb’s metaphysics of sensation.<a href="#_ftn365"
name="_ftnref365" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[365]</span></span></span></a> </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>It is to be presumed that Thomas
provided Veblen with many of his more important anthropological insights and
illustrative data.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Veblen’s sense of the
significance of anthropological inquiry may be further indicated by the
following statement written by Veblen to one of his students.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            As for the anthropological
reading, which I have inveigled you into, I do not </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            know that it will be of
much direct use, but it should be of some use in the</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            sense of an acquaintance
with mankind.  Not that man as viewed by the</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            anthropologist is any
more--perhaps he is less--human than man as we</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            see him in everyday life
and in commercial life; but the anthropological </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            survey should give a view
of man in perspective and more in the generic</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            than is ordinarily
attained by the classical economists, and should give</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            added breadth and sobriety
to the concept of “the economic man.”<a href="#_ftn366" name="_ftnref366"
title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[366]</span></span></span></a>  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            A further major influence
on the development of Dewey’s thought was that of the writings of William James. 
Perhaps more than any other factor, the “objective, biological approach of
Jamesian psychology” accounted for the shift of Dewey away from the Germanic
Hegelianism of George Sylvester Morris to Pragmatism.  Says Dewey’s biographer:
“William James’s <u>Principles of Psychology</u> was much the greatest single
influence in changing the direction of Dewey’s philosophical thinking.”</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            James’s influence on
Dewey’s theory of knowledge was exercised not by</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            the <u>Pragmatism</u>,
which appeared after Dewey’s theory had been formed, </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            but by chapters in the <u>Principles
of Psychology</u> dealing with conception,</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            discrimination and
comparison, and reasoning ...<a href="#_ftn367" name="_ftnref367" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[367]</span></span></span></a> </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Dewey himself comments on
the character of the influence of James in an autobiographical article
published in 1930.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            ... there are ... two
unreconciled strains in the <u>Psychology</u> [of William James].</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            One is found in the
adoption of the subjective tenor of prior psychological</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            tradition.  ....  The
other strain is objective, having its roots in a return to the</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            earlier biological
conception of the <u>psyche</u>, but a return possessed of a new</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            force and value due to the
immense progress made in biology since the time</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            of Aristotle.  ...it [the
latter strain] worked its way more and more into all my</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            ideas and acted as a ferment
to transform old beliefs.<a href="#_ftn368" name="_ftnref368" title=""><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>[368]</span></span></span></a> </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            At the hands of James, the
development of the pragmatic point of view moved from the determination of the
meaning of words and the vital importance of philosophic beliefs to an analysis
of the nature of truth.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            James showed, among other
things, that in certain philosophic conceptions,</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            the affirmation of certain
beliefs could be justified by means of the nature of</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            their consequences, or by
the differences which these beliefs make in</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            existence ...</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            From a general point of
view, the pragmatic attitude consists in “looking away</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            from first things,
principle, “categories,” supposed necessities; and of looking</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            towards last things,
fruits, consequences, facts ...</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            It is ... in submitting
conceptions to the control of experience, in the process</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            of verifying them, that
one finds examples of what is called truth.<a href="#_ftn369" name="_ftnref369"
title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[369]</span></span></span></a> </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The development of
Instrumentalism may be thought of as having emerged from  three primary
intellectual sources: 1) British Empiricism (the idea of experimental verification
in James and Peirce); 2) a critique of Germanic idealism regarding the theory
of knowledge and logic; and 3) an evolutionary, biological psychology (the
Darwinian impact on psychological theory).</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Dewey has identified the
nature and purpose of Instrumentalism in the following passage:</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Instrumentalism is an
attempt to establish a precise logical theory of</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            concepts, of judgments and
inferences in their various forms, by con-</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            sidering primarily how
thought functions in the experimental determinations</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            of future consequences. 
That is to say, it attempts to establish universally</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            recognized distinctions
and rules of logic by deriving them from the recon-      </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            structive or mediative
function ascribed to reason.  It aims to constitute a</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            theory of the general
forms of conception and reasoning, and not of this or</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            that particular judgment
of concept related to its own content, or to its</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            particular implications.<a
href="#_ftn370" name="_ftnref370" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[370]</span></span></span></a>
</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The social significance of
Instrumentalism and its relation to American experience is suggested in the
following remarks of Dewey:</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Instrumentalism maintains
in opposition to many contrary tendencies in</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            the American environment,
that action should be intelligent and reflective,</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            and that thought should
occupy a central position in life.  ... what we insist</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            upon above all else is
that intelligence be regarded as the only source and</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            sole guarantee of a
desirable and happy future.  It is beyond doubt that the</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            progressive and unstable
character of American life and civilization has</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            facilitated the birth of a
philosophy which regards the world as being  in</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            continuous formation,
where there is still place for indeterminism, for the</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            new, and for a real future
...<a href="#_ftn371" name="_ftnref371" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[371]</span></span></span></a>
</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Upon reflection, it will
be recognized that what has been developed in the last portion of this chapter
as the intellectual heritage of American heterodoxy in social analysis is but a
refinement and extension of the character of American experience considered in
the fore part of the chapter.  While the more precise analysis of the content
of the American contribution appears below, it should be apparent that there is
a close and causal relationship between American experience and American
heterodox thought.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            For example, the following
statement may be fruitfully compared with the views of Professor Parry (<u>supra</u>,
pp.61 and 77) regarding the role of American philosophy (and social thought
generally) in explaining the character of American experience.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            ... American philosophy
[Pragmatism and Instrumentalism] ... has given to</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            the subject, to the
individual mind, a practical rather than an epistemological</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            function.  The individual
mind is important because only the individual mind</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            is the organ of
modifications in traditions and institutions, the vehicle of</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            experimental creation. 
One-sided and egoistic individualism in American</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            life has left its imprint
on our practices.  For better or for worse, depending</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            on the point of view, it
has transformed the esthetic and fixed individualism</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            of the old European
culture into an active individualism.  But the idea of a</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            society of individuals is
not foreign to American thought; it penetrates even</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            our current individualism
which is unreflective and brutal.  And the individual</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            which American thought
idealized is not an individual <u>per se</u>, an individual</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            fixed in isolation and set
up for himself, but an individual who evolves and</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            develops in a natural and
human environment, an individual who can be</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            educated.<a href="#_ftn372"
name="_ftnref372" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[372]</span></span></span></a> </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            It will be noted that no
consideration has been given thus far to the intellectual origins of the ideas
of Clarence Ayres.  This exclusion is explained in view of the fact that the
works of Ayres are perhaps the most definitive and original combination of the
ideas of Dewey and Veblen.  And since the Ayresian portion of what is here captioned
the American contribution is of comparatively recent origin, it will suffice to
say that his work is a later product of the accelerating intellectual and
cultural forces previously considered.  As in the writing of his dissertation
at Chicago on the relationship between ethics and economics, Ayres has blended
the works of Dewey and Veblen and produced original ideas consistent with and,
more significantly, in an extension of his intellectual parental sources.  The
contributions of Ayres to the American heterodox analysis are explained below. </p>
