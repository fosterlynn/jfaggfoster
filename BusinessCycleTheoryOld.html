<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">There is no such thing as business 
cycles except in a very special sense, but there is such a thing as 
fluctuations in the level of economic activity. </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   At what level 
of “full” employment do we carry on the economic process?</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   There are two 
categories of economic problems: (1) how much of the means of life are 
provided, and (2) what kinds of the means of life are provided. The 
first is the one that concerns us in this course.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Actually, a business 
cycle is not a cycle in that it is regularly recurrent. It is determined 
by factors that are independent of time. </font></p>

Pure Monetary Theory</i>, and anything else by him.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">1-7:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Business cycles 
are not caused by something within the economic process itself; they 
are not chronologically rhythmical. There were ups and downs of varying 
intensity in the U.S. from 1790 to 1948. War always occurs just before 
the peak; that is, a peak always occurs after a war. This sequence always 
occurs in a capitalistic system, but it seems that there are some continuing 
factors in any institutional structure. If you think Jevons’ “sunspot” 
idea of business cycles has played out, read Gustav Cassel. Hawtrey’s <i>
Pure Monetary Theory</i> is the best statement of it. Also read:</font></p>

Demand ceases to be sufficient to recover the goods from the market.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     2. 
But, demand comes from consumers’ outlay.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     3. 
Consumers’ outlay is that portion of income spent in the <i>final </i>
purchase of goods, </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
and is therefore derived from consumers’ income.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     4. 
Consumers’ income is derived from production.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     5. 
Disequilibrium is caused by variations between consumers’ outlay and 
consumers’</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
income. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
a. If consumers’ outlay is greater than consumers’ income, we have 
expansion.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
b. If consumers’ outlay is less than consumers’ income, we have 
contraction or </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">             
recession.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
c. If consumers’ outlay is equal to consumers’ income, we have stability.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">      
6. This release or absorption of cash can be accomplished by one or 
more of three</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">          
groups in the economy.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
a. Consumers.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
b. Traders.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
c. Banks.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">      
7. But the release or absorption of cash is in response to effective 
demand, and so the</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">          
thing to do is to control demand. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">      
8. This can best be accomplished by stabilizing income, because thereby 
consumers’</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">          
outlay can be stabilized.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   What does demand 
mean? How much money is on hand; the rate of receipt of expendable funds; 
the quantity of goods in existence subject to exchange (particularly 
the classical definition); the quantity of money in the hands of final 
purchasers available for the purchase of goods (Hawtrey). All of these 
definitions are floating around.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Hawtrey says that 
demand comes from <u>consumers’ income</u><i>.</i> Consumers are the 
ones who buy the items with no intention of reselling. It includes fixed 
capital equipment but not land. Income subject to final expenditure 
is consumers’ income. It is money available for the final purchase 
of goods. <u>Consumers’ outlay </u>
is the actual purchase of such goods.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Difficulty is 
caused by variations between consumers’ outlay and consumers’ income. 
These differences result in release or absorption of cash, which is 
what causes the trouble. The three groups who have discretion over it 
are consumers, traders, and banks. “Consumers” is used in the ordinary 
sense of the word. Hawtrey notes that consumers’ expenditures don’t 
vary very much. It’s capital goods expenditures that vary. Also prices. 
So consumers really don’t have much effect on it; such expenditure 
is more a consequence than a cause. But consumer variation starts a 
little sooner than capital variation, although it doesn’t vary as 
much. Consumers have discretion in that they can spend more or less 
than their income. Traders can release or absorb cash in much the same 
manner but to a greater extent. They release cash when new security 
issues are greater than security issues called in plus gross profits 
over the same period. But Hawtrey doesn’t mean gross profits for the 
economy at large. Banks release cash when they buy securities and absorb 
cash when they sell securities. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   What is money? 
A legally designated medium of exchange.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">1-10: </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The pure monetary theory hinges 
around the idea of the release or absorption of cash. The problem of 
the distinction between consumer goods and investment goods is avoided; 
it deals only with aggregates. The level of employment is not a matter 
of whether you make consumer or investment goods but only a matter of 
whether you’re working (Hawtrey). The relationship between the two 
will come into some kind of balance.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The general theory 
of wages used in this theory is the orthodox supply and demand schedule: 
utility. But the pure monetary theory suggests that there is such a 
thing as ineffective demand, so it is a denial of the supply and demand 
theory of wages (and of Say’s law). (Incidentally, Foster thinks that 
Say’s law is true, which does not mean that there can be no decrease 
in economic activity.)</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   How can the economy 
be stabilized? It is purely a monetary business. <u>Stabilize income.</u></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">You can do something about 
it, although you can’t do much about consumers’ outlay. (Consumers’ 
outlay is analogous to propensity to consume.) So do something about 
consumers’ income. Most of this is in the form of wages. You can’t 
control wages.  But you can control some of the items that control 
wages. You can do something about demand for labor by controlling the 
rate of interest. The rate of interest is most effective for the wholesalers. 
(Brokers don’t care what the rate is as such; what concerns them is 
whether it will go up or down.) Almost all the wholesaler’s goods 
are purchased on commercial credit. If the rate of interest goes up 
it may wipe out his entire profit. So it is the wholesalers upon whom 
we must concentrate, by controlling the rate of interest. Through them 
wages can be controlled. Then consumer outlay will be stabilized; that 
is, there will be no violent fluctuations. (The quantity of commercial 
credit in existence just about equals the circulating capital in wholesale 
and retail stores, according to Federal Reserve Bulletins. Very few 
non-borrowed funds are being used. Some non-commercial credit funds 
are government credit funds. There is no other way to create capital 
assets than through credit, says Foster.)</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   What theory of 
prices does this theory—pure monetary theory—stand on? The quantity 
of money theory of prices; that is, the quantity of money in circulation. 
Fisher’s equation. We have almost four times as much money as we did 
in 1940; prices have increased three times. Under conditions of full 
employment there is some correspondence, but Fisher’s equation has 
to assume full employment. And under conditions of full employment what 
sense is there in talking about business cycles?</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   It all boils down 
to the fact that consumer outlay and consumer income are the same; you 
can’t get a disparity between the two. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Income is receipt 
from sales. Expenditures and receipts are the same. Y=C + I.</font> <br>

the best exponent of the monetary over-investment theory.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Return to pure 
monetary theory:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The only way to 
control is through wholesalers. You can’t control consumer outlay, 
price, wages, etc., because you get into such problems as too vast police 
control, black markets, etc.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Reexamination 
of the quantity of money theory: The equation <u>mv + m’v’</u>=P 
is a truism. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">                              <WBR>                                                         <WBR>                       
T                             <WBR>   </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">It is still accepted as true. 
But what these theorists are saying is that if M increases, P will increase 
proportionately. That’s not true. If you vary M, v and T also change, 
so the effect on P is not as anticipated.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   So they decided 
to encourage the wholesalers by making money available to them through 
certain banks.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   These theorists 
are confusing money and income. Curtailment of production affects income 
but not quantity of money. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">[Me: Questions raised while 
thinking and reading.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   1.  Are goods 
in the higher stages of production, i.e., higher order goods, producers’ 
goods, and goods in the lower stages of production consumers’ goods? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   2. Investment 
is addition to the supply of capital equipment beyond replacement of 
that used in the productive activity of the period. But if there is 
unexpected destruction of capital equipment (as by war or floods) is 
not replacement of it investment?  The multiplier would work on 
such investment, would it not?  Yes. And if productive activity 
is at a high level, thus wearing out capital goods very fast and necessitating 
a high level of production of capital goods for replacement, the multiplier 
works in this replacement even though there is no investment (as defined 
by Keynes), does it not? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   3. Income spend 
for replacement of capital equipment used in the productive process 
is not investment (as defined by Keynes). Then it is consumption. (Me 
later: <u>No</u>!) But this seems an odd classification. Or is it that 
money spent for such purposes <u>is not income?</u>  Yes. What 
about the distinction between net income and income? What is gross income? <u>
User cost.</u> It must be subtracted from gross income to get income. 
Is that it?</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   4. During the 
Great Depression replacement fell far short of the amount necessary 
to maintain the capital stock. (Hansen: F. Rec or Stag.) Then there 
was negative investment, and negative saving, and consumption. Right? 
I didn’t think so. We don’t know, but it probably was. Very well 
could have been. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   5. Does investment 
in Keynes mean gross investment? And income gross income?]</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">[More thoughts from me: Isn’t 
accumulation of capital investment? There are no profits in the aggregate; 
profits equal zero in the aggregate. What are profits? Return on capital? 
Some would say, I think, that profit is capital accumulation. There 
is in fact capital accumulation, or investment, isn’t there? Yes. 
If not, consumption would be 100%. Then capital accumulation or formation 
must not be profit. What is profit? That left after expenditures on 
consumption and investment? Is it formed through debt? If so, it’s 
clearly zero. Can something that is always zero be defined? If not, 
what is the definition of profit in the comprehension of the community? 
As indicated above, there is little or no disagreement as to its definition. 
And it can be defined. It is zero in the aggregate but not necessarily 
for the individual.]</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">1-12:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Hawtrey’s theory is confusing 
because (1) of the terminology and (2) it is concerned with the machinery 
and not the causes. </font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Monetary Over-Investment 
Theory</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   1. There are two 
kinds of goods, consumer goods and investment goods.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   2. The individual 
has the choice of which he will produce and which method of production 
he will pursue. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   3. Which he produces 
depends upon the relative strength of effective demand for each of the 
two kinds of goods.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   4. But the only 
way that a change in the production of one kind of goods can be accomplished 
is by a change in the production of the other.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   5. In the case 
of an increase in investment it can come from only one of three sources:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
a. Sales of securities.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
b. Plowing back profits.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
c. Bank credit.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   6. When bank credit 
is used there is a shift from the production of consumer goods to the 
production of investment goods, because of relatively increased prices 
of producers’ goods as compared with prices of consumers’ goods. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   7. Thus there 
is a reduction in the quantity of the factors used in the production 
of consumer goods and thus a reduction in the rate of production of 
consumer goods.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   8. The reduction 
in the rate of production of consumer goods, without a concurrent reduction 
in the quantity of funds available for their purchase, results in an 
increase in prices for consumer goods. This is what Von Hayek calls 
forced savings. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   9. As the price 
of consumer goods increases, and as the capital installations that preceded 
them come into use, the producers of consumer goods are enabled to outbid 
the producers’ goods for the factors. And so there is a shift of the 
factors back from the production of producers’ goods to the production 
of consumers’ goods. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  10. It is this constriction 
of the production of investment goods that constitutes depression.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  11. Therefore, the thing 
to accomplish is to maintain equilibrium between relative prices of 
consumer goods and producers’ goods. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  12. Therefore, the thing 
to do is to control bank credit and thus do away with forced savings.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   This is the theory 
that served as the major foundation of the Federal Reserve System in 
the U.S. and of the central bank in other countries. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   [Aren’t producer 
goods and investment goods synonymous? Yes.]</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The trouble is 
in the shift in the relationship between the prices of consumer goods 
and the prices of investment goods. If both sets of prices remain constant 
or vary together, there is stability. But if one varies more than the 
other there is disequilibrium.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   If production 
of producers’ goods is increased through bank credit, there is more 
money in the community and thus there is increased demand for consumer 
goods at the same time that there is decreased production of consumer 
goods. This is forced savings. But if production of producers’ goods 
is increased through the sale of securities this does not happen. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Out of this comes 
the University of Chicago 100% reserve plan. The idea of neutral money 
is advanced. It is money so dispersed that it has no effect on the relative 
prices of consumer and producers’ goods. Thus the production of producers’ 
goods has to come out of voluntary savings instead of forced savings. 
The banks would be controlled so that they could make no loans in excess 
of the amount of deposits on hand. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   It is the shift 
from producers’ goods to consumer goods that causes trouble. They 
seem not to be concerned with the shift from consumer to producers’ 
goods. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Actually, the 
production of consumer and producers’ goods vary in the same direction. 
This theory would have a little trouble explaining that. For this theory 
to hold, it is necessary to assume full employment. There is frictional 
but no involuntary unemployment. But in the case of history investment 
and consumption have always varied together. So we have never had full 
employment.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   In our system, 
there can never be full employment. Or complete unemployment. As full 
employment is approached, inflation is hit which stops the economy before 
full employment can be reached. (Russia’s entire foreign policy is 
built upon the assumption that we’ll have a depression.)</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Assuming the classical 
theory of wages and unemployment, this theory will work. Those beyond 
a certain point are voluntarily unemployed, so there is no real unemployment.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   This theory and 
the one we’ll take up next do no violence to the classical theories 
of wages and employment.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">1-13:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Back into the problem of hoarding. 
We know that “hoarding” is not a part of income. But can money be 
“hoarded”? All money is held all the time. Then either all the money 
there is, is “hoarded,” or there is no such thing as hoarding in 
the aggregate.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   In the underconsumption 
analysis, hoarding is thought of as the part of income not spent for 
consumption or investment. But income is receipt from sales. You can 
sell consumption or investment goods. What is hoarding a receipt from 
the sales of?  Ir can’t exist.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Individually, 
you can hoard. That is, you can receive income that you don’t spend 
for either consumption or investment. But by the amount that you hoard, 
someone else goes in debt, and for the community at large hoarding is

period. And so on. But that isn’t true in fact. What’s wrong with

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Depression is what Von Hayek 
speaks of as a shrinkage of the structure of production, which is a 
lessening of the round-aboutness of producing and hence of capital goods. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Depression is 
characterized by forced savings as opposed to voluntary savings. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   This round-aboutness 
concept is the axis upon which it is judged. How many steps are involved 
in the creation of a commodity? Bohm-Bawerk’s example is that of a 
man whose cabin is located near his only source of water-supply or spring. 
He can (a) go to the spring and drink, (b) make a dipper and go to the 
spring and use it to drink, or (c) make a pipe which brings the water 
to his cabin. The degree of round-aboutness is the structure. Depression 
is a restriction of that structure. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   By cutting down 
on the consumption phase, you can elaborate the round-aboutness. By 
abstaining from consumption, you can spend more time in producing capital. 
This idea came from Jevons, from thinking of machines as embodied capital. 
It focuses on what Bohm-Bawerk calls the theory of capital and interest. 
Capital formation occurs by not consuming. It is a decision of the entrepreneur 
relative to utility (want-satisfaction). What concerns us is the thing 
that determines how an entrepreneur makes up his mind. Abstinence in 
view of anticipated enhanced satisfaction of wants. You are making a 
choice in terms of time, and so the process is time-consuming. The time-consuming 
aspect of the process varies with the character of the structure. The 
higher the structure, the greater the time-consumption. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Look at the theory 
of capital formation in terms of the two kinds of goods. Consumer goods 
are those used to satisfy human wants; producers’ goods are those 
not used to satisfy human wants (directly). You have a choice as to 
what kind of goods you can produce. You can go to the spring and drink 
without the aid of a dipper (consumer goods), or you can make a dipper 
which will enhance the production of consumer goods later (producers’ 
goods). So a choice to make producers’ goods lessens the production 
of consumer goods. Then how can you reconcile the fact that the production 
of consumer goods and producers’ goods vary in the same direction? 
The theory still holds, they say, in view of the fact that you make 
a choice and your choice to make investment goods still lessens your 
potential production of consumer goods. That is, consumer goods production 
can go up when the choice is made to produce producers’ goods, but 
it would have gone up more if it had not been for this decision. So 
in terms of <u>potential </u>they vary still in opposite directions, 
even though in terms of <u>actual </u>
production they vary in the same direction.</font> <br> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   What they are 
saying is this: An increase in production of producers’ goods is not 
the same in all enterprises at the same time. The reason they go in 
the same direction is that income from producers’ goods eventuates 
in increased demand for consumer goods, to some degree. So the increase 
in the latter is due to the increase in the former of the previous period. 
It is a matter of acceleration. The incidence of incline of production 
of consumer goods in one period is due to the incidence of incline of 
production of producers’ goods in the previous period.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The theory of 
capital formation when stated in terms of round-aboutness comes out 
to be a little different from the theory of capital formation as more 
frequently stated. The critics usually attack on the basis of the fact 
that production of the two varies together. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Inflation is attained 
before full employment is attained. It is impossible to reach full employment. 
True inflation is that situation in which an increase in the rate of 
effective demand does not result in an increase in the offerings of 
the things demanded. That would be full employment. You can get neither 
true inflation nor full employment. You get a degree of inflation first 
that disrupts the economy. You get as low as 100% propensity to consume. 
[Me: You can get lower than that.]</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The normal is 
the situation that results in the use of neutral money. This doesn’t 
mean that there wouldn’t be any bank credit. You increase or decrease 
the amount of money “needed “ to keep it neutral. (With integration 
of industry you need more money; with trust-busting you need less.) 
Neutral money is such that it has no effect on the prices of producers’ 
and consumers’ goods. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">1-17:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The round-aboutness of the 
productive process is not the same thing as the division of labor, although 
our text says they are the same thing. It is rather the division of 
capital. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The amount of 
capital per capita means the structure. The structure is a function 
of the quantity of capital in use. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   This theory has 
given rise to the notion that depressions come out of booms. You shouldn’t 
let things get too good or they’ll get equally bad later. (There is 
a diagram here showing the schedule of employment, illustrating Von 
Hayek’s application of the theory to depression, giving the theory 
of wages and the number of units employed.)</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Combine this theory 
with Say’s law and it would appear offhand that you couldn’t have 
depressions.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   These theorists 
reconcile this theory with the level of employment and income. (There 
is another diagram here showing Y, C, and I fluctuating over time.) 
They reconcile the two through the idea of frictional unemployment. 
Example:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">      
1. Round-about process (more time-consuming per unit of production).</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">      
2. Direct process.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   In the formula, 
P/T, T (time) remains the same in both #1 and #2, but in #1, P (production) 
is less. So they have P going up and going down at the same time, because 
they say that #1 is more productive. It is both more time-consuming 
and more productive, in the same time period. But that’s impossible. 
In fact, both consume the same amount of time, but #1 produces more. 
It becomes absurd. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Another assumption 
is that producers’ and consumers’ goods are fundamentally different—in 
a physical sense, not an institutional sense. That’s not true. The 
distinction is institutional: whether it makes a profit or not. As a 
matter of fact, all goods are consumed, in that they are destroyed through 
use. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">1-18:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The durability of the goods 
is not pertinent to this theory. It is the purely institutional distinction 
between goods that is pertinent. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   In this theory 
the general price level would decline, but individual prices could rise. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   This theory says 
that debt causes depression. (Debt of course is the same as bank credit. 
Private debt cancels out.) </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Hansen and Hayek

true inflation is that it wipes out debt. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The rate of interest 
as such has no effect investment. It can be no greater than the marginal 
efficiency of capital. It is the expectation of a change in the rate 
of interest that has an effect. </font></p>

perhaps the most widely held business cycle theory held today.among 
businessmen. </font></p>

by requiring 100% reserves for banks. </font></p>

plan is an outgrowth of the monetary over-investment theory.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Non-Monetary 
Over-Investment Theory</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">This conceives of the initial 
causes of fluctuations being non-monetary. Gustav Cassel is the maturest 
exponent of this theory. There is a rather striking similarity between 
this and the previous theory, in that both are applications of the same 
general theory, supply and demand. Outline of the theory:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   1. Depression 
is a downward fluctuation in the production of capital goods. (The same 
as the monetary over-investment theory.)</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   2. The upswing 
is in response to new opportunities for investment. These new opportunities 
are occasioned by new inventions, the development of new techniques, 
the discovery of new markets, new frontiers, or by events such as a 
hailstorm or war. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   3. The labor to 
produce the new capital equipment cannot be withdrawn from the production 
of consumer goods, because (1) variations in both are in the same direction, 
and (2) variations in the level of production of consumer goods are 
less than variations in the level of production of producer goods, in 
fact even when the variations are in the same direction. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   4. Then where 
do they get the additional labor, within the general supply and demand 
theory? They get it from workers already employed—in agriculture. 
Agriculture is a peculiar kind of enterprise in that when labor is decreased, 
production does not go down. The institutional structure is such that 
arrangements can be more easily made to take care of the problem. They 
say that this is true also because of technological reasons. (This is 
not true, but it is true of the institutional structure.)</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   5. When the new 
fixed capital is completed, the variation must continue in the same 
direction or it will taper off. (A truism.) What they say is that if 
there is no additional non-economically-determined incident to continue 
the demand, the rate of demand for fixed capital goods falls off. Constriction 
therefore. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   6. Also, when 
this new productivity reaches its maximum utilization of its available 
means (when all agricultural workers possible have been shifted), a 
demand in agriculture is increased, and thus halts the shift. Thus there 
is a price halt as well as a physical halt in the shift of labor. Agriculture 
prices go up. Also raw materials and the interest rate. As long as the 
expansion occurs, the ratio between agricultural and industrial purchasing 
power increases.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   7. All these rises 
in cost reduce the market value of capital assets by virtue of having 
raised costs.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   8. Therefore, 
there is a constriction in the production of capital equipment, and 
that’s what constitutes depression.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   9. So depressions 
are characteristic of transitional phases, so they are beginning to 
disappear with the closing of new frontiers, maturing in technology, 
etc. (Now they’ve sort of changed their minds.) So you really shouldn’t 
do much about it; the world is settling down and things will sort of 
smooth out of their own accord. (You can’t have progress without depression.)</font> <br>

Cassel’s analysis there is no ethical or moral factor. In both instances 
the fluctuation is brought about through the rate of interest, but in 
the one those who save are not the ones who come into the possession 
of capital assets, and in the other there is no forced saving and thus 
those who save are those who gain title to the capital assets. </font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Underconsumption 
Analysis</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Ancient lineage. 
Ricardo won in his controversy with Malthus.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   According to Say’s 
law, there can be no insufficient effective demand, no under-consumption. 
It is difficult to refute. According to Malthus, however, goods exchange 
not for goods but for money; hence, there can be ineffective demand. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The theory usually 
takes the form, today, of the tendency of the supply of goods to outrun 
the purchasing power, due to inequality of income. Classical analysis 
took the position that S=D; thus there could be no over-saving. Savings 
in the aggregate do not decrease consumption in the aggregate. (This 
was held by Smith and Ricardo and up through Senior; the neo-classicists 
did not hold this.) Only the capitalist decreases his consumption. Savings, 
according to Malthus, result in additional production while at the same 
time is decreased effective demand. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The central substance 
of the argument hasn’t changed much since Malthus. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   (C.E. Ayres also 
clearly sets forth some aspects of the under-consumption analysis: <i>
The Theory of Economic Progress, The Problem of Economic Order, The 
Divine Right of Capital.</i></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>   </i>
Central substance: It is inescapable that there should come about a 
deficiency of effective consumer demand, because if any income is not 
spent, either for consumption or investment, there will not be enough 
spent to clear the price tags because the sum of the price tags includes 
prime cost, --------, and --------. People do not spend all of their 
income; something is wrong with our institutions that this is so. Malthus 
centered his attack on the problem of unemployment. Sufficient effective 
demand cannot come from wages or there would be no profits, nor from 
profits or there would be no savings, so it should come out of rent. 
The classical theory of the rate of interest is a concept of the demand 
for and the supply of savings (brought into equality by the rate of 
interest). The under-consumptionists agree except as to the shape of 
the supply schedule of savings. (Keynes disagrees with both.)</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Taussig conceived 
a negative rate of interest; the under-consumptionists a more elastic 
supply schedule.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Malthus says businessmen 
are just too busy to spend all their income in a time of prosperity, 
which tends to cause depression. In times of depression they spend more 
than their income, which gives an impetus toward prosperity. Thus he 
got a cycle.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Hobson, later, 
got depression theory. No cycles. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   From 1933 to 1936 
our country was using the balance-the-budget theory of the classicists. 
It didn’t work. Then we tried the under-consumptionist theory: don’t 
balance the budget. It didn’t work too well either. The classicists 
said Y=C + I. The under-consumptionists said, no, Y=C + I  + H 
(hoarding). Hayes said that as long as there is a positive rate of interest, 
there will be H. Interest is an incentive for holding money as such. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Then Keynes came 
along and said Y=C + I. Since Keynes came out we have been applying 
his theory even when we don’t admit it. So are all the other countries, 
including Mexico.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">1-25:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">As long as there is a positive 
rate of interest, people build up prices of established debts, and there 
is hoarding. This is the under-consumptionist position. But this very 
activity decreases the rate of interest. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The rate of interest 
is, in fact, sometimes low at the bottom of the cycle and sometimes 
high. It does not have much effect as such on the amount of investment. 
It has effect only indirectly through its effect as it is related to 
the marginal efficiency of capital.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Investment is 
expenditure made with the expectation of gaining a return. It is the 
expectation of change, not the quantity of funds, that is important. </font> <br>

<p align="center"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Back to Under-Consumptionism</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The market process provides 
no way for the maintenance of continued sufficient effective consumer 
demand, because it makes it mandatory that individuals do not spend 
all of their income in the period of its receipt. Hayes and Malthus 
take the position that they cannot do so. The central core of under-consumption 
theories take exception to the classical tradition that there is no 
motive for holding money as such. They take exception to the Marshallian 
theory that money has no utility. Under-consumptionists say that it’s 
true that money has no utility as such for the community at large, but 
to the individual it gives satisfaction to have money. Get a concept 
of the diminishing utility of money in contrast to the classical theory 
of the constant marginal utility of money. Get the answer that the difficulty 
lies in the inequality of distribution of money. Also get the idea of  
incentive taxation. The comparative rigidity of prices (or elasticity) 
causes insufficiency of effective demand. If prices always varied directly 
with the purchasing power needed to recover the goods from the market, 
the under-consumptionists would have a very difficult time supporting 
their position. Hobson especially went to great lengths to demonstrate 
that price does not vary in such a fashion; It is an institution, and 
it is customary and traditional. Prices are a moral issue. The point 
is very ably demonstrated. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   When you have 
a variation in effective demand, you get a variation in price rather 
than in production. Under-consumptionists had to re-examine their analysis 
in the light of that happening. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The quantity of 
money people hold is not a function of the amount of income spent. The 
quantity of money people hold is simply all the money there is.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">1-27:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Hobson does not hold that saving 
equals investment. It may for awhile, but when there is over-investment 
the result is ineffective consumer demand, which results in the inequality 
of saving and nvestment. </font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Keynesian Theory</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   If the supply 
and demand (classical) theory of employment holds, you could increase 
N in four ways:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">1. Reducing frictional unemployment.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">2. Decreasing the marginal 
disutility of working in order to decrease voluntary unemployment:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">    a. Decrease 
social insurance, etc.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">3. Increasing real wages by 
a reduction in the price of wage-goods. ((Increasing marginal physical 
productivity of labor in the wage-goods industries.)</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">4. A rise in the price of non-wage-goods 
relative to the price of wage-goods. (Would result in #3.)</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Keynes sets out 
to prove that this same theory requires both an increase and a decrease 
in the price of wage goods in order to increase N, and you can’t have 
both. He is right. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   He has two objections 
to the supply curve:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">1. Labor does not respond to 
a change in real wages as it does to a change in money wages. As money-wage 
rates go up, real-wage rates go down, in fact. What you get is an increased 
offering of labor with an increase in disutility, which is incompatible 
with the classical theory. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">2. There is no expedient whereby 
the laborer can adjust his real wage. The market process offers no way. 
The bargaining between employer and employee does not determine real 
wages, although it may determine money wages. (The escalator clause 
is based on Keynesian theory. It may not work out; sometimes could result 
in spiral. So long as the firm is not operating at the firm is not operating 
at the supply-price schedule, it will work.</font> <br></p>

is determined by the inducement to invest.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">7. The inducement to invest 
depends upon the relationship between the marginal efficiency of capital, 
i.e., the return on investment, and the rate of interest. If the marginal 
efficiency of capital is greater than the rate of interest, there will 
be investment, i.e., production of capital goods.</font></p>

equality with its supply price. Or the ratio of expected yield to supply 
price. This concept is useful because it gives you a way of determining 
the termination of capitalization. In pre-Keynesian analysis there was 
no way of determining the value of land according to capitalization.

is the same as that of the under-consumptionists—that the forces of 
the market, without interference, lead to insufficient demand i.e., 
depression. But he differed with the under-consumptionists in the reasons 
for this result, and therefore in the public policy that should be carried 
out.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The Propensity 
to Consume</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Determinants:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">A. Objective factors, discussion:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     1. 
The propensity to consume varies directly with the wage unit, which 
is the same as     </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
saying that a rise in the cost of living causes a greater amount to 
be spent on </font></p>

Of some importance in the short period: Cost is not brought into consideration; 
such </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
gains are uncalculated. “Easy come, easy go.” Windfall losses have 
similar </font></p>

community at </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">

specific time.  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
(Speculation is the expectation of gaining a return through a variation 
in price.)</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     4. 
Not particularly important except insofar as they affect the price of 
capital assets </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
(windfall gains and losses). Indirect result only. Savings vary inversely 
with the rate</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
of interest, not directly as the classicists hold. The classical theory 
conceives of</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
interest as the price of saving, or that price that equilibrates the 
demand for and the</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
supply of savings. In fact, when interest goes up investment goes down. 
Therefore, </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
the classical theory, which holds that a rise in interest would cause 
a rise in savings </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
and investment, is not right. Keynes: what people pay for by interest 
is the use of</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
money. They pay someone to part with liquidity and to purchase a debt. 
So interest</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
equilibrates the supply of and the demand for money. (This last statement 
is </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
unfortunate.)</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     5. 
A tax on large incomes, e.g., will increase the propensity to consume. 
Sinking funds</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
will lower it. Also retiring bonds, selling securities by Federal Reserve 
banls, and</font></p>

of objective factors determining the propensity to consume.</font></p>

Changes in the expectations of the difference between present and future

If he expects the latter to be higher than the former, his propensity

be higher.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">      
Keynes and the under-consumptionists agree that depression is caused 
by a deficiency in effective demand. Their reasons for the deficiency, 
however, are different. The under-consumptionists say that saving is 
greater than investment. Keynes says that <i>efforts</i> to save might 
reduce effective demand. The three independent variable are the items 
that determine effective demand: propensity to consume, rate of interest, 
and marginal efficiency of capital. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Now we consider 
the subjective factors determining the propensity to consume. There 
are two categories, one for individuals and one for corporations.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The inducement 
to invest, as we have said, is a function of the rate of interest and 
the marginal efficiency of capital. The latter is the ratio between 
the prospective yield and the supply price. The prospective yield, A-U, 
is symbolized by Q. Add up Q1, Q2,, etc., and you get the prospective 
yield. (The supply price is the price necessary to induce a producer 
to produce an additional unit of capital; it is not the market price.) 
The ratio between prospective yield and supply price gives us the marginal 
efficiency of capital. The schedule of the inducement to invest is that 
schedule that will bring that ratio to unity. The rate of discount that 
will bring the prospective yield into equality with the supply price 
is the marginal efficiency of capital. (The marginal efficiency means 
the efficiency of each additional unit. It doesn’t refer to aggregates.) 
The extension of investment in any particular capital asset causes the 
marginal efficiency of capital to decrease, although the aggregate efficiency 
increases. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The schedule of 
the marginal efficiency of capital, however, will not alone give us 
the rate of investment. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">2-3:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Keynes does not say that incomes 
should be equal. Nor does he deal with an ism; he describes the existing 
facts.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Investment flows 
toward those industries in which the marginal efficiency of capital 
is highest. A schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital of all 
industries will give you an investment schedule, but you still don’t 
know what investment will be because you still don’t have the rate 
of interest. Investment will continue as long as the investor thinks 
he can make more money there than elsewhere. The entrepreneur can hold 
his money in case, or buy an existing debt, or buy capital assets. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   In his criticism 
of the classical theory of interest, he brings up two points to approach 
the matter: </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     1. 
Observation shows that we do not have an increase in the rate of saving 
when we </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
have an increase in the rate of interest. Rather, the rate of saving 
decreases. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     2. 
Then what does equilibrate the demand for and the supply of savings? 
The rate of</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
interest does not; it is a payment for parting with liquidity. It would 
seem to follow </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
that the inducement to invest is that schedule which would bring the 
marginal </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
efficiency of all types of capital into equality with the rate of interest. 
The reat of </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
equilibrates the demand for and the supply of money. Three determinants 
of </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
demand:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
a. The transactions motive.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
b. The discretionary motive.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
c. The precautionary motive.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">2-4:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The distinction between Keynes’ 
and the classical theories of the rate of interest. (Both are supply 
and demand theories.)</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     1. 
The classicists say that interest is payment to induce people to save. 
Keynes says it</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
is inducement to people to part with liquidity.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     2. 
The classicists say that interest is a price equalizing the demand for 
and the supply </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
of savings and that the demand for savings is the same as the demand 
for capital.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
Keynes says the demand for capital goods and the demand for savings 
are </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
dependent variables. They both depend upon the propensity to consume, 
the rate of</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
interest, and the marginal efficiency of capital. The amount of cash 
that people</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
choose to hold, according to Keynes, is independently determinant of 
the amount of</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
investment that people choose to make. The demand for capital is in 
part dependent </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
on the rate of interest. The classicists consider the demand for savings 
as the same </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
as the demand for capital. Keynes does not.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     3. 
The classicists hold an automatic (or at least unique) investment of 
savings. Keynes </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">        
holds that they overlook the effect on income of not spending for consumption 
or</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">        
investment. (Keynes did not hold that an increase in the quantity of 
money </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">        
automatically reduces the interest rate, although it would appear from 
this that he</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">        
might. But there are necessary and concomitant events on the other side 
of the</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">        
equation. A change in the quantity of money affects all three independent 
variables.)</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Liquidity preference. 
Increasing the quantity of money doesn’t affect whether people hold 
it or not; they hold all of it all of the time. But the demand for money 
changes.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Determinants of liquidity preference:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">1. Transactions motive. Enough 
money to carry on business. Two factors: (a) carry on current transactions, 
(b) take care of current expense before receipt of money payment for 
sales that are being made currently. Transactions funds vary directly 
with income.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">2. Precautionary motive. Desire 
to be secure in meeting expected and unexpected expenses in the future. 
Also to be able to take advantage of some suddenly appearing opportunity 
to gain (A bargain or something.) Varies directly with Y.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">3. Speculative motive. The 
object is to secure profit from knowing better than the market what 
the market will do. Knowing what changes will occur as a result of expected 
changes in the rate of interest. (You can shift only in differential 
liquidity, not in aggregate liquidity.) Expectation of gain through 
a variation in price. It is different from investment, which is expectation 
of gain through the use of an asset, and from gambling. In gambling, 
gains and losses exactly offset each other; in speculation, this is 
not necessarily true.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Quantity of money (supply of 
money) depends upon:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">1. Central banking policy.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">2. Government fiscal policy.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">2-7:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The supply of money is not 
determined by abstention from consumption but by the above-named factors. 
This is very significant. If investment is not a function of abstention 
from consumption, many answers may turn out to be different than previously 
supposed.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   If everyone tries 
to get liquid, the interest rate rises. Banks would probably then be 
inclined to supply more funds, that is, to create money. Individuals 
are the same as banks in increasing supply insofar as they make available 
more of what they hold. The difference is that when banks lend they <u>
cannot </u>make use of what they don’t lend, while when individuals 
lend they <u>can </u>make use of what they don’t lend. The lending 
power of both is reduced, but the kind of liquidity preference is different 
in each case. The motives for liquidity preference would seem to be 
a little different in the case of  banks than in the case of individuals. 
The transactions motive doesn’t apply to banks; all they need is enough 
money for day-to-day transactions, and they can get this from the Federal 
Reserve Bank. The precautionary motive applies to both, but perhaps 
a little differently. The speculative motive is probably identically 
applicable.</font></p>

a rate of interest—the “own rate.” The own rate of money is the 
rate of interest. If the own rate of wheat is greater than the own rate 
of money, people will prefer to buy wheat. In order for people to buy 
any asset, therefore, its own rate must be greater than the rate of 
interest. Otherwise, people would prefer to hold money, because:</font></p>

is therefore the most important own rate, for the above reasons. Another 
reason is its low elasticity. In this sense it is different from other 
commodities. You can’t go into the business of making money. The power 
of the bank to produce money is set by law as to quantity, and so the 
incentive for making money doesn’t work the same as the incentive 
for making automobiles. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The effect of money changes 
in the wage-unit. Classical theory says that a reduction in money wages 
will reduce prices and thus cause an increase in effective demand and 
encourage entrepreneurs to expand and thus raise the level of employment. 
Price is the automatic adjustor. Such reasoning comes about by taking 
the case of an individual entrepreneur and raising it to the level of 
the aggregate. Keynes says, however, that the two situations are different. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Keynes asks, does 
a reduction in money wages have an effect on the level of employment, 
given the three independent variables? This is an illogical (a nonsensical) 
question, because there can be no effect without an effect on these 
three variables, which <u>are</u> the determinants of employment. This 
is similar to the question the classicists ask on that score. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Does a reduction 
in money wages have an indirect tendency to affect employment as a result 
of its effect on these three independent variables? Keynes asks this 
question. First, what would be the effect on the propensity to consume 
of a reduction in money wages? Income would be redistributed, from wage-earners 
to (1) the rentier, (if prices have been reduced in proportion to the 
fall in money wages), or to (2) the entrepreneur (if prices have not 
been so reduced). So there would be a decrease in the propensity to 
consume. Second, what would be the effect on the marginal efficiency 
of capital? The immediate effect could be to raise expected proceeds, 
but the expectations could not be realized, unless the propensity to 
consume were 100%. And in fact the propensity to consume goes down, 
so the marginal efficiency of capital goes down in spite of expectations. 
However, the question of foreign trade enters. Investment by foreign 
countries might go up. The total effect on the marginal efficiency of 
capital then depends on whether entrepreneurs expect the money wage 
to go down more, stay the same, or bounce back. If the last, the marginal 
efficiency of capital will go up. If the first, the marginal efficiency 
of capital will go down. So the answer to this question depends upon 
expectations for the future. Usually, however, when wages go down there 
is an expectation of a further fall, so a fall in the money wage results 
in a fall in the marginal efficiency of capital.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Effect on the rate of interest. 
A reduction in money wages would reduce liquidity preference.(through 
the transactions motive), which would reduce the rate of interest and 
therefore increase the inducement to invest, and therefore the level 
of employment, <u>unless</u> a further drop in the rate of interest 
is foreseen, in which case liquidity preference (the speculative and 
precautionary motives) would go up and the rate of interest would go 
up and the inducement to invest would go down. In other words, if the 
reduction in the rate of interest is thought to be terminal there will 
be a rapid rise in investment, but if the reduction in the rate of interest 
is a trend investment will go down. People just wait until it hits bottom.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   We are in part 
stymied by this because we can’t change the rate of interest on old 
debts. Even if we could, a reduction of interest rates could be brought

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">2-22: Keynes’ theory of prices.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Take off from the quantity 
of money theory. If effective demand varied directly with the quantity 
of money, then, “So long as there is unemployment, employment will 
change in the same proportion as the quantity of money,” etc. If there 
is full employment, price changes. But there are some difficulties in 
this. He explains prices, then, as a deviation from Fisher’s equation, 
by virtue of some complicating factors:</font></p>

Effective demand does not change in direct proportion with the quantity 
of money.               </font></p>

there are</font></p>

of prices might be stated a little differently. An increase in the quantity 
of money will raise both employment and prices, and as you approach 
full employment the increase in prices is at a faster rate than the 
increase in employment, so as you approach full employment you approach 
true inflation. So inflation keeps you from full employment. On the 
other hand, it affects the ratio between the rate of interest and the 
marginal efficiency of capital through its effect on prices. </font></p>

of some stoppage of supply (labor, land, or something), and prices will 
go up in those areas. Certain commodities can command terrific prices. 
In Keynesian theory, here is the connection between monopoly and inflation. 
Monopoly makes the bottlenecks appear sooner in relation to the level 
of employment—the less close you can get to full employment. Monopoly 
is in a position to increase prices. In effect, monopoly is a bottleneck—a 
way of increasing prices rather than production.</font></p>

For capital formation to come out of voluntary savings, it would have 
to be. It really comes out of credit. We get positive capital formation 
all the time, through bank credit. Then the question is asked, how do 
entrepreneurs pay it back? They don’t. If one does, another acquires 
the debt. There is no way to pay off debts for the community at large. 
Individually, debts are paid—one pays his debt, and another acquires 
one. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Before we know 
how much capital formation is during a period, we have to take out user 
cost. How do we know how much it is? It is conceived as the difference 
between what the entrepreneur <u>has</u> and what he <u>could have had</u> 
if he hadn’t produced. It’s a little fuzzy, but the entrepreneur 
can calculate it. But our bookkeeping methods don’t account it—part 
of it isn’t necessary to business operation from the viewpoint of 
the entrepreneur. What Keynes is saying is that capitalism is a credit 
kind of economy, that you can’t have capitalism without credit. Credit 
can be either bank credit or printed money. Thus his theory is not destructive 
of capitalism but is in fact the only explanation which admits of its

that Keynes discusses depression from the standpoint of investment rather 
than consumption. The latter is very important but relatively constant, 
so he focuses his attention on investment and decisions to invest. But 
I guess he holds that decisions to invest come from changes in the rate 
of consumption. A slight change in the latter causes a rapid change 
in the former. The propensity to save is determined by the factors that 
determine the propensity to consume. Thus it is important but doesn’t 
vary so much as the factors that determine decisions to invest. In a 
depression the propensity to consume goes up, so the propensity to save 
goes down. But I thought that everyone <u>wanted</u> to save in a depression 
(liquidity preference) but <u>could</u> not. Am I confusing propensity 
with incentive or desire? I guess so. Propensity is tendency or habit, 
not desire…. Saving and investment are kept equal by variations in 
income, not by decisions to save and/or invest. The only way you can 
stabilize the economy is to control income (employment). You can’t 
control propensity to consume or inducement to invest. Then how can 
you control income? Government investment.]</font> <br></p>

here. Keynes says that when goods come out slowly, inventories decrease 
even more rapidly. When the rate of coming-out increases, inventories 
increase more rapidly. Last year when the production and consumption 
of wheat were at an all-time high, there was more of a glut of wheat 
than at any other time—a substantiation of Keynes’ theory. In fact, 
the rate of investment turns up after an increase in income. This too 
supports Keynes. The better things get, the better you expect them to 
get, and the worse they get, the worse you expect them to get. The under-consumptionists 
say that the inducement to invest is greater when consumption is low, 
because people expect things to get better. And the inducement to invest 
is lower when consumption is high. That’s not true. </font></p>

that at a period of low income the desire to invest may be high because 
people think things will have to get better, but would-be investors 
couldn’t get money. Banks had plenty of funds but wouldn’t lend. 
Farmers couldn’t borrow a cent. Bankers knew that agriculture was 
losing money.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">3-2:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Credit is outside the market 
process. The quantity of money is determined by government fiscal policy 
and central banking policy, both of which are determined independently 
of the market process. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Continuation of comparison 
of theories: </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   In the monetary 
over-investment theory the trouble is with credit, which is non-market-determined. 
(In the non-monetary theory, it is any item.) If you follow it through, 
you come to the conclusion that it is impossible to create more capital 
in the long run than people choose to save—in the monetary over-investment 
theory. It is different from Keynes in that in Keynes all capital formation 
is out of credit, and none out of voluntary savings. In fact there are 
no voluntary savings, according to Keynes. Either Hayek or Keynes, then, 
is dead wrong. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   In the over-investment 
theory, a boom has an inevitable bust. What foes up must come down. 
The Hoover Administration was applying the monetary over-investment 
theory. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">(1) we had to pay for our orgy 
of producing in the 20’s—it was inevitable—all we could do was 
to try to ease the downswing. That is x <u>had to</u> equal y, but it 
could be spread out a little so we could adjust to it. So we should 
make some funds available to those who invest, so we gave the banks 
a lot of money. That didn’t help. So we created the RFC to make funds 
available to anyone who can convince the administration that he wants 
to invest. That didn’t help. The farmers still couldn’t get any 
money. So we created the Federal Land Bank. That might have helped a 
little. Incidentally, it made money by lending to farmers who had been 
turned down by bankers who thought they couldn’t make any money. So 
application of this theory didn’t help; things continued to get worse. 
The community was getting desperate. Then Roosevelt got in and did some 
experimenting. He didn’t have any theory, but he did <u>something</u>, 
and during the thirties we began to realize that Keynes’ theory would 
work.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">3-3: In regard to Say’s law:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Keynes holds that the fact 
of production does not create sufficient effective demand to maintain 
that level of production. Things are sometimes produced which can’t 
be sold. This is an attack not on Say’s law but on an imputation of 
Say’s law. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   All Say’s law 
as such proposes is that the creation of a product distributes its money’s 
worth to the factors. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Both over-investment 
theories operate as if the imputation (corollary) of Say’s law were 
true. Keynes says it doesn’t hold. Keynes says that if products are 
sold by virtue of a decrease in price which came about by virtue of 
a decrease in effective demand, there will be a diminution in the rate 
of production. He says that if you have pure competition there will 
be no diminution in the rate of effective demand, but there will be 
no return on capital. But where there is a struggle for the market there 
will be a diminution.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">3-4: Alvin Hansen.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Hansen is difficult to classify 
as to the theories we have been considering. He is Keynesian, but his 
influence in business cycle theory has not been of that character. His 
contribution, however, is primarily an application of  Keynesian 
theory to problems in our economy. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   He has long recognized 
the insufficiency of investment. Even if consumption were stabilized, 
collapse would occur. There is a chronic inability to use the factors 
of production, inherent in our economy in its present structure. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The more recent 
Hansen work has been almost purely Keynesian, but he is of interest 
to us largely because of his earlier work in connection with business 
cycles. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   How does insufficient 
effective demand affect our use of the factors through its effect on 
the inducement to invest? Hansen posed this question. Our kind of economy 
is geared to work under conditions of expansion, and we have reached 
the point where it is no longer possible to expand as rapidly as is 
necessary to maintain full employment. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Three things in 
this connection he points out:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">    1. A matter 
of population. In one hundred years our population has increased 100,000,000 
people. In the present century, world population has declined. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">    2. A great 
many frontiers were opened up in the 19<sup>th</sup> century. At the 
beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup>, most of these were closed. In America 
the frontier was land. A frontier is something that does not have to 
be entered as a factor cost (recovered in production). </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   3. The employment 
of labor in the production of capital goods as such. Since the turn 
of the century, technological innovation has been of the character that 
requires less of the factors—capital-saving as contrasted with capital-consuming 
of the previous century and a half. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Whereas Keynes 
proved that expansion is a requisite for prosperity, Hansen concludes 
that new investment opportunities have been and are disappearing. This 
has been occasioned by the three factors mentioned, which have really 
been a lessening in the rate of expansion rather than an absolute decrease. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   How can we maintain 
the necessary rate of increase increase in effective demand to maintain 
employment, Hansen asks. We had trouble on that score even when we were 
expanding very rapidly. In the past we have done it through bank and 
increasing investment, but they have been only partially effective. 
We seem to be working through a central banking policy, but that isn’t 
enough.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Three ways to 
maintain purchasing power:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   1. Increasing 
investment.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   2. Spending consumer 
hoardings.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   3. Government 
finance of new credit.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Try to get people 
from wanting to hold money.  Provide sufficient social security 
so that there will be a weakening of the precautionary motive to liquidity 
preference. Try to weaken the speculative motive and strengthen the 
investment motive. Lessening the precautionary and speculative motives 
won’t be enough. We must try to strengthen investment.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   No longer can 
business investment be relied upon to distribute sufficient purchasing 
power. Because we can get greater and greater productivity through the 
use of fewer individuals, we can’t rely on business to do it. We must 
connect the banking system with the ability of individuals to purchase 
for consumption. Consumers’ increase must be maintained at a sufficiently 
expanding rate to maintain employment. It must be independent of the 
pattern of motivation which our banking system necessarily follows. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Do this by:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   1. Building up 
government reserves in the boom period and paying them out in the downswing. 
(Corporate reserves act in the opposite manner because they bring about 
the juncture which they wish to avoid.)</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   2. Old age assistance 
is better than insurance. How can the government do it? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
a. By making and withdrawing deposits in banks.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
b. By investing in securities  (in its own bonds, primarily).</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
c. By creating funds and using them to pay current expenses</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
d. By hoarding and dishoarding. (Hansen uses the word to mean holding 
money.)</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">He looks at the effects of 
each of these items:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
a. If you have an increase in these deposits or a decrease in the velocity 
of circulation</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">           
you need large bank reserves. Also you must keep reserves sufficient 
in </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">           
depression. It won’t cure it but it is necessary for recovery Also, 
aid banks in </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">           
making consumer loans—guarantee them.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
b. If bonds are bought on the open market, the effect is deflationary, 
because the </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">           
owners of bonds on the open market have such a propensity to consume 
that they</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">           
don’t need to use these funds. So the government has to buy its own 
bonds for the</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">           
most part, which really transfers government debt to wage-earners and 
decreases </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">           
insecurity, which encourages spending.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
c. You have both effects at the same time. Reduce inclination to invest 
and increase</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">             
capacity to purchase. He doesn’t know quite what to conclude. If producers </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">             
respond to an increase in effective demand, it would be inflationary. 
(Depends</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">             
upon level of employment.) This leads to a shift in basis of taxation. 
It can be</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">             
deflationary because it can be used to shift the burden to those lease 
able to pay.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
d. It can’t be done. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   He urges abolition 
of any special tax on employees and pay-as-you-go. Don’t accumulate 
funds to meet anticipated expenditure. Collect when you need it, and 
pay it out as you collect it. You can’t prime the pump; you have to 
furnish the water. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   What can you do? 
If it’s inherent, you could just resign yourself to it.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">3-9: Eclectic Theory</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">It presumes that there are 
cumulative causal factors in each phase of the cycle that bring about 
the ensuing phase. First, in Mitchell, in the upswing there is a lag 
in wages (payments to the factors) behind prices. This results in an 
opportunity for increasing rates of profits. However, as this proceeds, 
surplus labor is absorbed and the less efficient units are brought into 
use, and wages go up in relation to the productivity of the labor purchased. 
Second, the lending capacity of banks is approached, and banks raise 
the interest rate. Third, the prices of raw materials begin to soar, 
especially as each raw material approaches its physical limits. These 
increases result in a narrowing of the profit margin, which results 
in a constriction of banks’ willingness to lend. Then businessmen 
make a strong effort to attain liquidity by selling immediately as many 
goods as possible. To do this, they have to reduce prices. Reduction 
in prices makes it more difficult to get liquid, and it gets worse. 
The same cost factors that lagged going up also lag going down. (Sticky 
prices.). They cause the depression to deepen. This continues until:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   1. The banks get 
too much “stock” on hand, so they lower the interest rate. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   2. Wages fall 
below the immediately past normal relationship to prices.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   3. This continues 
until the prices of raw materials fall sufficiently to enable them to   </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
be used in production profitably, possibly.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Then, Mitchell says, you’re 
on the upswing again, in view of the profit margin newly arrived at. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Thus there is 
a true cycle inherent in the economy. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Commodities are 
not sticky; they respond to supply and demand. Interest rates, wages, 
and raw materials are sticky. Monopoly prices don’t change much, regardless 
of the period of the cycle.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   It is the stickiness 
of these prices that occasions the difficulty. It is really a function 
of the comparative variations in various prices. So theorists of this 
school usually talk of stabilizing the cycle through stabilizing prices. 
The other theorists are not interested in stabilizing prices. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   If you stabilize 
all prices, then what? Some have considered the matter in terms of competitive 
prices as compared with monopoly prices. (Usually sort of under-</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">consumptionists.) In fact, 
historically, those commodities whose prices vary a great deal vary 
little in quantity of production, and vice versa. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Can you do away 
with monopoly? Can every enterprise be competitive? How about telephone 
companies in Denver? It would take a great many to have competition. 
You can’t eliminate some monopolies. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   How can you vary 
prices? With general price level? If so, you would have to see that 
costs would also so vary. That would include wages. How would you vary 
these? Set wages, rents, commodity prices, everything.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Another alternative 
is to make the unsticky prices sticky. But your comparative advantage 
is to get your price relatively higher, and everyone would so act, so 
price would become infinity and production zero.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">3-10: </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">What would be the policy implications 
of the eclectic theory?</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   What makes the 
upswing stop and the downswing begin? What makes the downswing stop? 
In the upswing, it seems to me that an approach to full employment could 
cause a break in prosperity; that is, it is one thing that could cause 
repercussions that would lead to the downswing. But in the downswing, 
what could it be? Is there a floor to employment? It isn’t 100% propensity 
to consume. Consumption can be greater than income. How much greater? 
What is there at the trough of the depression that causes expectations 
to be greater than before the trough is reached? Nothing inherent in 
the economy that I can see. It may be that the government stepped in 
with expenditures at this point, whereas it didn’t before things got 
that bad, but this isn’t a cyclical thing.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   What causes prices 
to level off?</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Is it really a 
matter of comparative stickiness? The sticky prices have to become less 
sticky than the unsticky ones at some period in order for them to cross. 
How explain that?  Mitchell says that the sticky prices get unstuck. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Keynes’ theory 
is like this: </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">      
Quantity on the horizontal axis going up and down slanting downward 
to the right.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Mitchell doesn’t 
consider the trend as pictured above, just the fluctuations around it.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Most students 
of the business cycle now say that Mitchell’s presentation is not 
an explanation of the business cycle. In a depression something outside 
of the market process has to step in to turn it up; there is nothing 
within the economy that will do it. It keeps going down until something 
happens, like a flood or a war. It looks like this:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
Like the one above: quantity on the horizontal axis fluctuating up and 
down. There is a continuous downward trend. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Theories about 
stickiness of prices:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   1. Mitchell: Commodity 
prices not sticky; factor prices sticky.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   2. Others: Stickiness 
depends upon amount of transportation involved in producing a </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
commodity. The more transportation, the greater the stickiness.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   3. Others: In 
terms of monopoly and non-monopoly. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Array distribution 
of prices:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     Quantity 
sloping upward toward the right, then leveling off, then up again.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Those who approach 
it from monopoly picture it thus:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">      
Re use of the factors, wheat sloping slightly upward; “still”(?) 
steeply up, then down.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The eclectic theory has eventuated 
into all sorts of “plans,” such as the 100% reserve plan. (The eclectic 
plan itself is more a description than a theory.)</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Another is the 
Douglas plan. It is something of a mixture—under-consumptionist, Keynesian, 
neo-classical, Hawtrey—maintaining and controlling purchasing power 
so as to stabilize price level. Widely circulated during the depression:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   1. A public works 
program, concentrated around housing.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   2. A flexible 
governmental budget—easily raised above and below tax receipts.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   3. A nationally 
managed currency and credit system, so that the government should </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
take over the creation of credit to:</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
b. Stabilize the general price level.</font></p>

of a national wage policy, so that you could control wage units—floors, </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
minimum wages, etc. This was proposed so that:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
a. Wages could be raised in case prices or efficiency goes up, so that 
there would be </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">

b. Wages could be lowered if prices or efficiency goes down.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   5. Make arrangements 
to maintain flexible prices of commodities, within the general</font></p>

are small.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   6. Unemployment 
insurance, which is one way of transferring purchasing power from</font></p>

of purchasing power to those who have very little of it,thus raising 
effective demand.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   8. If this doesn’t 
work, create a separate economy for the unemployed. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   This plan demonstrates 
an almost total lack of coherent thinking, about a general theory, of 
the community at large. It is a sort of admission of inadequacy of understanding, 
as is most eclectic theory. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   We have tried 
Douglas’ plan, in some part, all over the place—public works, flexibility 
in the budget (but not as he proposed, not set a budget), etc..</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   National wage 
policy has raised a lot of debate. We couldn’t figure out what the 
wage bill should be, but we have decided on some wage rates. At first 
a minimum rate of $.25 was set. Many businessmen insisted that they 
would go broke in short order. But probably nobody ever did; most of 
them made more and more money. The acceleration principle must operate 
very rapidly. But such a bill really should have a provision for the 
immediate loss that a businessman might experience. Many, however, began 
to get orders as soon as the bill was effective.</font> <br></p>

and external economy in terms of employment problem.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   There have been 
notable efforts to connect the level of employment with such matters 
as the balance of trade—controlling the level of economic activity 
internally in an international community. (Bretton Woods is an example 
of what grows out of this.)</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   In India bad times 
are apt to come in the presence of a decrease in the level of income 
accompanied by an increase in the level of employment. There is very 
great wealth in that country, in liquid form.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   In our country 
bad times come in times of unemployment, while at the same time there 
may be an increase in income. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   What seems to 
have occurred in India is that during periods of plenty a large amount 
of unemployment is exported, with “treasure” coming in. Then in 
periods of hard times, those who have share with others. But you can’t 
eat gems. However, the tendency toward revolution is not there, because 
the hungry masses don’t see food held back from them. There just isn’t 
any. In our community there is much more production and less “treasure,” 
so in depression the hungry can see the food that they can’t get because 
of the mal-distribution of money. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Our monetary system 
is different. Modern money takes the form of bank credit and coins and 
currency. What is the supply schedule of money? (Keynes’s treatment 
of it in the rate of interest theory is unfortunate.) It has no supply 
price, as do gold and silver. It is not a commodity.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   In India the whole 
supply of food is open to everyone in periods of poverty, but there 
just isn’t any there. If we exported out products and put away in 
Fr. Knox the gold we received for them, our situation might be same 
as that of India. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   In India there 
is a way of exchanging goods produced for commodities that they can’t 
consume, such as gold and silver. We have no such possibility. We have 
to exchange for money, and in our society money isn’t a commodity. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The mercantilists 
had always suspected that they could export their unemployment in a 
community like ours. It can’t be done in India, but it can here. So 
some sort of hazy idea of this has persisted throughout the period of 
classical ascendancy, even while the classical economists were insisting 
that imports and exports had to balance. (We’ve had a favorable balance 
every year since 1891.) </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   At Bretton Woods 
the economists began to fool with the idea that maybe if we had an international 
money we could get paid for a favorable balance. (They were probably 
wrong.) The dollar became that international unit except that it is 
legal tender only in the U.S. So the recipients of dollars can’t buy

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
to the character of money. But money has no supply price, is not a commodity. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The things they 
produce are the things they consume; the things we produce are not the 
things we consume—they are the means of producing what we consume.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The mercantilists 
always thought you could export your unemployment. In India you can’t. 
But we can. By giving goods away we can have more goods at home than 
if we didn’t have a favorable balance of trade. Throughout the period 
of the ascendancy of the classical period, this notion has persisted 
among separate notions even though the economists were arguing against 
it.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Keynes and White 
at Bretton Woods thought they could keep a favorable balance of trade 
and get paid by using international money (turned out to be the dollar). 
If you’re going to receive payment in dollars, you have to buy goods 
and services from other countries to the same amount as exports. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Compensatory spending: 
By taxing away the peak of the boom, fill in the depression trough. 
Also see to it that undistributed corporate profits are used in the 
depression. This is presented as an application of the Keynesian analysis, 
but if Keynes is correct, such a program won’t succeed. It would merely 
make the depression lower. What you should do is to fill the whole thing 
in, not only the trough, for all income to equal that at the peak of 
the boom.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   A compensatory 
plan, in Keynesian terms, could only succeed if in times of inflation 
(when prices were increasing faster than employment), very high taxes 
were levied. This would increase employment even at the time, and could 
be spent later when employment started to go down. But in times of ordinary 
prosperity without inflation, taxation without equivalent spending is 
deflationary. You just level off demand and start bringing on the depression 
for which you’re preparing. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   When you have 
true inflation you have full employment, but less and less production. 
Everybody is getting rich speculating, and everyone starves to death. 
All trade and no industry. Keynes said (wrongly) that production wouldn’t 
be any less at this point.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">3-16:  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Forced savings does not mean 
that the community is forced to save but that consumers are forced to 
cut down on consumption due to a rise in prices and to the fact that 
they spend all their income on consumption. It is not really saving; 
it is only abstention from (lessening of) consumption.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   It is the enforcement 
of a reduction in consumption by reason of an increase in price, occasioned 
by an increase in capital formation purchased with bank credit. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Marginal efficiency 
of capital: What is prospective yield? The schedule of effective demand 
is factor cost plus profits, or it is the money income of the remainder 
of the community. But this is independent of his judgment. Sort of a 
circle, because what he pays out is a part of effective demand, but 
the part is infinitesimal.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Keynes doesn’t 
explain prospective yield very well. But expected return is in the same 
direction as current yield. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Non-market seems 
to mean for purposes other than making money, and also which does not 
result in a price tag representing factor cost plus profit. Like bank 
credit—has no supply price but is worth as much as gold. </font></p>
