<p class=Body><b>lecture 2</b></p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Last time I was trying to
eliminate some of the difficulties which I have felt inhibit the study of
social sciences.  In that connection, I mentioned several items and, at the end
of the hour, we were concerned with this sequence of events in the development
of value theory, in the development of a particular criterion<i> [utility]</i>
being raised to the level of comprehension that we have been speaking of as
articulation, and then its bifurcation<i> [into pleasure and pain]</i> and the
development out of that bifurcation of nihilism, and then the reorientation of
value theory.  I gave you a few examples--the Greek Stoics and Epicureans. 
....</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            To illustrate what I was
saying about this bifurcation and reorientation <i>[within the utility theory
of value]</i>, I would like for us to take a glance at how people have thought
about the problem of value within historical times.  We aren’t very clear on
anything prior to that time.  As you know, the ancients--particularly the
Greeks after they learned to read and write ... (It didn’t take them but a
thousand years after they got acquainted with people who could read and write. 
Pretty smart folks, the Greeks; not as smart, of course, as college students at
this time.  It doesn’t take them quite that long--usually.)  ... were directly
concerned with, and understood, the problem. </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Particularly, I should
say, their great triad--Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle--began to try to make
sense out of community policy and social analysis generally.  And they began
also to associate with the economic process.  At that time, the stage of
analysis was such that you can find two very divergent kinds of formulations
resulting from these two bifurcated approaches to the value problem.  One we
have captioned, in a general way, Stoicism, the other, Epicureanism.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            I suggested last time that
what they were looking at was the same thing, but they were approaching it from
two different avenues.  In the case of the Epicureans, the utility positively,
and the Stoics, disutility.  Or if you will, in recent years, the parallel
between real cost analysis and the utility theory.  I think also, in the
present state of affairs, we can discern efforts at reconciliation of these two
in the current literature.  It has taken several forms.  One, an effort to
disregard the problem altogether but, since it cannot be disregarded in fact,
an unadmitted use of a common basis of estimation, and that the present state
of affairs is confused in a fashion that it never has been confused before
because of the rise in recent years of instrumental theory.  Heretofore, there
has never been any real excuse back of this bifurcation.  Always, I think, they
were talking about utility.  In the present conjuncture of circumstances, they
aren’t talking about it very much, but they are using two different kinds of
theory or of value back of this bifurcated stage<i> [i.e., the utility and the
instrumental theories].</i></p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Now the Greeks thought and
talked with each other and the rest of the world as if they were talking about
two different kinds of things, the Stoics talking as if what they were using as
a criterion of judgment--utility--was altogether different in their
analysis--disutility.  I’m talking about their analysis since, as I tried to
make plain to you to start with, people have always used<i> [the instrumental]</i>
theory of value because there isn’t any escape from it, and we will have more
to say about that later.  But they thought they were talking about two
different kinds of things.  I think they weren’t.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            We now are, in fact,
talking about two different kinds of things.  The one--utility theory--is as
old and certain as human history, and comes with a whole complement of
theoretical apparatus which permits its application in analysis to any
particular problem.  It comes equipped by virtue of the five or six thousand
years of the recording of human thought.  I think all utility theory uses that
apparatus.  The other--<i>[instrumental theory]</i>--which we will try to
identify in this course, comes unequipped.  It has no application-level
formulation.  There is no theory of valuation ready to use.  There is no
concept, for example, comparable to the cost concept we find in the classical
economic analysis.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Just now, we are beginning
to realize for the first time in history that we need an economic accounting of
value theory.  That is to say, we have come to realize that the conceptual tools
with which we have accounted our affairs are not economic in character.  They
are something else--business tools.  And they were business tools at the time
of <i>[the Greeks]</i> no less than they are today.  These tools are highly
refined, and there are a great many of them.  We have become experts in using
them.  And we have come to realize that they aren’t what we require.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            This realization is, I
submit, the necessary outgrowth of the realization that it isn’t utility with
which we are concerned.  These tools do about as well with the utility theory
of value, I suppose, as could be done.  The complexity and minuteness and
fineness with which they have been manipulated and arranged and rearranged ...
is something to be astounded at.  And then we have come to realize that what
they are good for isn’t what we require.  And, I repeat, that realization is a
result of the already accomplished efforts at reidentification of what is the
theory of value, at what is one step back of these bifurcations and recombinations
and rebeginnings.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            And so the bifurcation,
which is really a dichotomy, in current thinking is a different thing than has
occurred before.  Heretofore, it has been one step this side of value theory<i>
[i.e. analysis has been  concerned with the theory of valuation rather than the
theory of value]. </i> Like the Epicureans and the Stoics; like the cost
theorists and the utility theorists.  All of them are talking about the same
thing:<i> [the utility theory of value]</i>.  In the literature, for example,
you find--especially in economics, but also in anthropology-- you find the
classical theory proper, as well as the neoclassical theory, distinguished in
terms of the theory of value they use.  The distinction is not in the theory of
value at all, but in the theory of valuation, in the theory of how you go about
measuring value, whatever it is.  The labor theory of value--so-called--of Adam
Smith, David Ricardo, and Karl Marx--the classical theory proper, is a theory
of how you measure the real worth of something.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Now the utility theory of
value is a theory of value in so far as it is a theory.  But we do not consider
that at all.  What we consider is the theory of valuation, which comes to us in
the form  of price theory, or supply-price theory, or cost theory in the form
of price theory, all of which presumably parallel the actual fundamental
operations in human behavior with the experiencing of utility and disutility
and the anticipation of it.  And so what we are now concerned with is not the
theory of valuation, but the theory of value itself.  The two general
developments now are not theories of valuation, but theories of value, one--I
repeat--coming well equipped with the theory of valuation in two forms of price
theory and labor theory; the other unequipped.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Note the great difficulty
those of  you who have formed opinions and what-have-you on the instrumental
basis, have in applying that theory to a particular problem.  That is the third
part of this course: What theory of valuation do you use to measure instrumental
efficiency?  How do you go about it?  What is, in some sense, more than
something else?  Immediately you will recognize that we are not yet equipped
with the necessary tools.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Now, first, I want to get
this bifurcation thing in order, and also the utility theory, how utility
theory easily lends itself to that kind of taxonomy <i>[of bifurcation]</i>. 
Let us use the ancient <i>[distinction between utility and disutility].</i> 
They insisted that there is a missing middle here, that they are different
things.  Are they?  I have said that the Greeks seemed to be talking about the
same thing.  They are approaching the same item from two different avenues, two
different facets.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Well, are they, or aren’t
they?  Are they in fact two different things?  Were the Stoics talking about
different matters, using a different criterion of judgment than the
Epicureans?  Note that they behaved differently.  In fact, the word Epicurean
has come to mean someone who wines, womens, and songs, with no thought for
tomorrow.  A Stoic has been defined as someone who has reconciled himself to
the discomforts of human life, reconciled to his fate.  I submit that a Stoic
is an Epicurean who has been beaten on the head considerably.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Test it in your own
behavior.  If you were ever in the army you will know exactly what I am talking
about.  You can be quite human and even happy, and then you hit a series of
systematic and organized insults--well, isn’t that what a peacetime army is?--
and what is your reaction?  You freeze up.  You take it, we say; you sweat it
out.  You become a Stoic.  You become an Epicurean who is being hurt.  It’s a
survival characteristic, you see.  You have to be that way.  And if you will
look carefully at the Greek literature, you will find that the Epicureans came
from very well-to-do people.  They talked and acted that way.  They had
numerous statues in their gardens, and worshipped Bacchus very frequently.  He
was the god who gave you an excuse for getting drunk without violating the
law.  But if you were a poor man, you couldn’t very well worship Bacchus. 
Bacchus was an expensive guy; he was the big shots’ god.  It’s the difference,
of course, between intoxication and drunkenness.  The poor man gets drunk and
the rich man gets intoxicated.  But you’re in the same condition.  Now Epicurus
himself would lament greatly that anyone would use him as an excuse for getting
drunk, because he was quite a guy.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            But that was a minor
incident; the actual facts are otherwise.  Yes, I think the Epicureans and
Stoics are talking about the same thing.  They are talking about pleasure and
pain, or want satisfaction.  Where they differ is on the characteristic
experience being one way or another.  Both have resigned themselves at
different spots on the utility axis: one is on the positive side where it feels
good; the other on the negative side where it hurts.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            And note the great
accomplishment of the neoclassicists, because in the latter part of the 19th
century they got both on the same axis, with negative<i> [utility or
opportunity cost]</i> a different place on the same axis.  They made disutility
and utility the same thing, just different locations.  A little bit of
disutility is just a little less of something than a very little bit of
utility.  All along in this situation where there is in fact no missing
middle.  There are two different ways of talking about, looking at, and
approaching the central problem so nearly the same that they could live in the
same community quite well.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            It would be completely
impossible if you could in fact apply two different theories of value.  It
becomes tolerable by virtue of the fact that you can’t apply them, and the
level of intolerableness that you experience is by virtue of the fact that in
the one instance all you can do is try to apply it, and in the other you in
fact apply it in terms of working, actual behavior.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The Greeks and other
ancients pretty well understood not only this general problem of valuation and
of value, but also the problem of institutions and how the concept of value is
involved in institutional problems.  As you know, Aristotle made an effort to
analyze the economy in what he called home economics--household economy. 
That’s how economics got started.  And he pointed out, for example, the famous
quotation which every sophomore encounters: the uses of any article or tool. 
For example a shoe, may be worn or it may be exchanged for something else.  And
he goes on to say, as you recall, that the first is “proper” to the object and
the second in some sense is “improper.”  In his time, it was “improper” in the
sense that gentlemen didn’t exchange shoes.  In fact, gentlemen didn’t do much
of anything.  They never have.  They don’t yet.  In fact, isn’t that how you
prove that you are a gentleman?  You just don’t do anything.  You demonstrate a
very high degree of abstinence from the productive process.  You don’t get your
hands dirty.  That sort of proves you’re a gentleman.  And you demonstrate that
adequately by your dress, your behavior, etc.  You spend all of your time being<i>
[idle]</i>, an invidious display of the capacity to waste.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Well, modern man is
distinguished, I submit--and I’m thinking of Aristotle this way--not only by
his technological achievements but by his institutional achievements as well. 
He is peculiar in the technological sense, but his distinction is not
attributed to that.  As early as the Greeks, that began to be apparent.  They
began to distinguish between “proper” and “improper” on some other grounds than
what they were saying.  What they were saying had a terrific effect upon what
they were doing, as it always does.  What they were thinking clearly had a
great effect on what they were doing.  In fact, it determines what you do,
where you have to make choices.  It determines what you do in all problematic
situations.  And as early as the Greeks, the beginnings of what we call “modern
man,” both his institutional accomplishments and his technological
accomplishments, were beginning to be apparent.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            In that sense, you see,
all that we are concerned with is the modern period, as it were.  Man became
what he is only a short while ago.  The illustration I like to use in that
respect to get that in mind is that, if you put the whole of known human
experience on one sweep of the <i>[minute]</i> hand of the clock, man learned
to write less than two minutes ago.  That’s the whole of written history right
there.  Man was here a long time before that.  In the history books, we speak
of “modern history” as beginning with Columbus, the discovery of America. 
Particularly in the U.S. we do that.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Man learned to write just
yesterday, as it were.  And already he had learned a great many things
technologically and institutionally, and he is distinguishable from what came
before by his accomplishments in these areas which, of course, is what we call
civilization.  Man began to be civilized in a scandalously rapid manner because
he began to be able to accumulate his theory.  As soon as he learned to write,
you see, he could put it down.  That is an important matter.  And only a few
minutes ago, as it were, in the middle of the 14th century, he began to learn
to print so he could say it over and over again.  And then everybody could
learn what everybody else said, and then, of course, he was on his way.  He is
on his way so fast that he can’t even see the events go by.  ....</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The peculiar
characteristic that I speak of as modern man is that he deliberately applies
theory to the solution of his problems, not only technologically but
institutionally.  That is to say, he lives sufficiently differently than the
other species that you can very readily tell the difference.  We call each
other dogs and sons of dogs, but we know the difference.  There isn’t any
difficulty.  However, there are tribes yet who are primitive enough that it’s
not quite--they have to prove they are better than monkeys. They don’t like to
be called anything like that; they constantly prove that they are better than
monkeys.  We are not emburdened that way.  I think we can now proceed with
sufficient confidence that there is considerable distinction.  We can even joke
about it and not get angry about it.  But they couldn’t.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            And that characteristic is
at bottom the recognition of the place of value theory in the everyday life of
everybody.  Not only in the social area of our experience but also in
technology.  In physics no less than economics or no less than aesthetics.  And
another thing: I shan’t present a thesis at the moment in this regard, but
another thing began quite discernibly at that point: science.  Science in the
sense that man uses it on the street corner.  And, of course, he uses it
correctly.  Science and philosophy we say began with the Greeks with the
development of some things that permitted us to get highly organized and
continuously developing bodies of thought.  That is to say, theory.  Science I
guess we could characterize as building generalizations and constantly
verifying or negating those generalizations through singular and individual
application, applications being made in the form of hypotheses.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Philosophy is a deliberate
effort to think coherently over the entire area of man’s experience.  We say
science and philosophy began here, and it just happens that it couldn’t be any
other way, I think, because at that point man began to apply theory
deliberately in an organized and conscious way.  That happens to be true in
both what I have termed philosophy and science, and it just happens that they
are the same things.  They had to begin together, because they are the same
things, I think.  We think of philosophy as a deliberate effort to think
coherently over the entire area of our experience, to set forth the inclusive
and continuing factors of the whole of human experience.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The universe of philosophy
is the whole of human experience among men.  The whole of his social
experience.  Science, what the man in the street calls science, is the same
thing restricted to particular universes--in the statistical terminology a
universe being a separately identified area of inquiry.  The science of
physics, or the science of biology, or the science of economics, etc.  Now no
science, you see, takes the position that it is not related causally to all
other areas, all other sciences.  Certainly the chemists and the biologists
can’t say that chemistry and biology are unrelated.  They are convenient areas
for deliberate and concentrated inquiry.  And when they get so close together
that they can’t distinguish it by name, they call it bio-chemistry.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The reasons for not only
the congruity I have indicated but also the simultaneity that has in fact
occurred, will be embodied in the identification, I hope, of philosophy and
science, as I hope to make it in this course.  What I’m saying, of course, is
that it was not accidental that they are simultaneous.  They are, I think, the
same thing.  Now, holding that as hypothetical for the moment--for the next six
weeks--I think we can prove it.  Man at that point began to think carefully and
extensively enough about his institutional affairs as well as his technological
affairs that he could in an organized and deliberate way set down the theory of
value.  And it seems to me that he got off on the wrong track.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            But right or wrong, the
track he got off on is the utility theory.  And that still is the most common
sense of the community.  It is still held that, in order to be human value, it
had to be utility.   Now, we call it many different things, but kick it around
a little bit and scratch the paint off and you’ll find John Stuart Mill’s
utility.  Sometimes they speak of “need.”  And what does a person “need?”  
Well, if you boil it all out, you will find Mr. Utility standing there.  The
satisfaction of wants.  Both heterodox and orthodox theory.  The utility theory
of value.  And it is that theory of value which is supposed to give meaning to <i>[life’s
experiences]</i>.  This can very easily be set up in terms of utility.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Now, this becomes
questionable if you set it up in terms of utility.  But the sciences dealing
with human affairs, particularly those dealing directly with the psychology of human
motivation, in which you are asking how people go about making decisions (which
seems, at first blush, like what the philosophers are and were asking...  But
let that go for the moment.)  The difference between science and philosophy has
been carried down to now as a missing middle in this sense: that they are two
different kinds of things.  Not, as I shall propose, that <i>[philosophy]</i>
is simply a larger universe of inquiry than any one of these that we have been
calling science, but they are the same thing at any given level of 
inclusiveness.  That the philosophy of atoms is exactly the same thing as the
science of atoms.  That the philosophy of human motivation is exactly the same
thing as the science of human motivation.  And suffice it for the moment, until
we come to it inescapably, note that if you get different answers from these
two areas, we already know in terms of behavior that one or the other at
least--maybe both--are wrong.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            But if we get a different
answer in regard to human behavior out of what the man on the corner calls
science and what the man in the ivory tower calls philosophy, then the children
of both know that somebody is in error.  Then we ask ourselves, well, which is
right, the philosophical method or the scientific method?  Which is correct,
the scientist or the philosopher?  Then somebody studies economics or sociology
or some sort of science and thereby gets himself confronted with that question,
and his response has been several.  But the modal average is: they’re both right
or, don’t look at it.  But of course students won’t let you not look at
anything.  They peek.  And what you do is say, well, at bottom<i> [philosophy] </i>is
the determination of the ends.  Now, after you have determined that we use this
to attain those ends, the general situation in the literature you will note,
and many times deliberately set forth--as by Lionel Robbins (bless him)--that
the ends are determined philosophically and all the rest is determined
scientifically.  Sometimes it is said this way: where you are going is
determined philosophically, and how you get there is determined scientifically.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Now, in finding out how
you get there, you may come out with an inequality  with the necessary
corollaries of where you are going, and when that occurs, somebody is wrong. 
We already know that much.  Then the immediate question, of course, would be,
is it necessary and inescapable that these two have common points.  If it is
necessary and inescapable, then these aren’t different things at all--science
is the same as philosophy.  If this isn’t true, it seems to me, it would be
possible to make the two incompossible although existing in the same frame of
reference.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'><b>lecture 3</b></p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Last time I think we were
discussing the concurrence of the development of what we call philosophy and
science.  I tentatively defined science in regard to building generalizations
in evidential terms, capable of verification through singular applications of
those generalizations.  I indicated that the building of a generalization and
the process of verification through application were not separate, nor could
either exist without the other.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            At the same time, I think
that I indicated that philosophy is an effort to think coherently over the
entire area of our experience, which proceeds in the identical fashion of
building generalizations which are inclusive in the sense that they are common
to all human beings, and verifying or negating the validity of these
generalizations by observing singular applications.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Of course, those two
statements are not only generic, they are identical, or almost so.  And there
is a reason for this conformity between them.  The reason is that science and
philosophy are the same thing, that is, the same intellectual process.  They
are the same kind of human operation.  The old caption “natural
philosophy”--which was how the degree Doctor of Philosophy got its name--was a
doctorate in natural philosophy, as the sciences at that time were called.  And
I think that happened because of the realization that they were the same. 
Since then, however, we have learned to avoid that realization in some detail. 
But I think that when we get down to it, the only difference between science
and philosophy is in what statisticians call the universe of inquiry, the
universe of applicability of the principles.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            In the case of philosophy,
it’s an effort to develop the principles which are applicable to all known
phenomena.  In the case of science so-called, deliberately restricted
applicability.  The science of optics has to do with looking at things.  There
is such a thing as just looking at things, and you just say, “Now we are going
to inquire into this looking and develop principles applicable to that
phenomenon.”  Now as you work back toward more inclusiveness, you work back toward
philosophy.  And when you hit philosophy, you hit all humanly discernible
phenomena.  And so, I would take the position that philosophy is the
all-inclusive science.  Individual sciences are simply singular applications of
philosophy, differing only in the inclusiveness of their respective universes. 
And I would like to try to get rid of what seem to me to be unconscious
misconceptions relating to these two general working concepts of science and
philosophy.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The question is whether
philosophy and science are two opposite extremes of the same attribute, whether
philosophy deals with the extremely normative and science with the extremely
not-normative. If what I have just said has any validity at all, of course, the
answer must be no.  Science and philosophy are not differentiable on that sort
of basis.  They are not distinct by virtue of the kind of phenomena
investigated, nor in terms of the degree of any attribute in that sense.  If it
be true that philosophical principles are to be applicable to all human level
experiences, all communicable experience, they are not distinguishable as being
opposite extremes of the kind of thing considered.  Nor are they
distinguishable in regard to questions of fact or not-fact, or more or less
fact.  Philosophical questions are as much questions of fact as any scientific
questions are.  They are uniform and parallel in all these senses, and likewise
in their kinds of operations.  They are not opposite extremes of an axis
depicting any combinations of attributes, and they are not different in a
missing middle sense in which one goes so far and stops, and the other takes up
and continues.  They cover the same areas and explain the same things in the
same fashion.  Now, they may both be mistaken, but there can be no contravention
by one of the other in fact.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            All of these things are, I
think, frequently misconceived without articulation or conscious
comprehension.  We say “That is a philosophical question!” meaning not factual
but something else.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>STUDENT: <i>“In common argument it is
usually put forth that you can corroborate scientific explanation, such as the
Archimedes Principle, but you cannot do so in philosophical explanations
because of unpredictability of human nature.  How do you explain that away
here?”</i></p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Well, of course, it is
clear that my position would be the contrary of that.  And I think not only
contrary, but most frequently it is easier in fact to corroborate, to
demonstrate the philosophic than the scientific.  We have been acquainted with
those inclusive facts longer, and often see them more clearly.  ....</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Economists generally set
up the distinction between philosophy and science in terms of value: the latter
has nothing to do with value, but the former does.  It is a different kind of
thing and not quite facts in the sense that science is facts.  Science deals
with opaque facts (that’s Veblen’s way of saying it), but philosophy, leave
that to the philosophers, under the supposition that philosophy doesn’t really
mean anything anyway, and no one listens to the philosophers anyway.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Economists set up their
science of human relations in those functions involved in providing goods and
services, or the means of experience.  And in that provision, the analysis
comes to focus in ... the operation of the human mind, the kinds of judgments
he makes, the combinations of the factors, how the entrepreneur makes up his
mind, and what forces are at play in causing him to judge this or that or more
or less.  And every consumer buying more chewing gum and less axle grease because
of variations in price levels.  No value, says Lionel Robbins; they make
judgments.  Under what criterion?  Well, the criterion is the theory of value. </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Now, how economists could
have failed to understand that the very core of what they are examining is how
people make judgments, which involves the theory of value, escapes me.  And
making a judgment, of course, ... involves the theory of value.  And a judgment
made is specified in a determinate way by the criterion used in choosing among
alternatives.  Yet we say we are not concerned with value judgments but with
science.  Well, what is science concerned about?  Value judgments.  And that’s
all!</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            When you get below that
level ...</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            (Shall we say below? 
Notice the influence of the invidious connotations of the language in my
speech, because I was about to identify, for example, a numerical
identification  and the listing of attributes as something less than, below,
science, where science would involve the comprehension of the relationships. 
The difference between thinking and stacking things up.  The difference between
the theoretician and the clerk.  The difference between the bookkeeper and the
accountant.)</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Well, I think there is a
distinction there.  I shouldn’t have said “below.”  “Different than” would be
accurate.  One is the application of theory to the problems involved, and the
other is a routine mechanical operation, like running through the
multiplication tables over and over again.  You see, we try our best to make
you into clerks, even in the first grade.  If you spit over someone’s shoulder
in improper circumstances, the teacher makes you write on the board a hundred
times after school, “I shall be a good boy.”  All the time you are thinking up
ways to be as bad as possible, to get even with the unkind treatment imposed on
you and thus, of course, like Adam Smith’s economic man, accomplish a purpose
which is no part of our intent.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Yes, I think philosophy
and science are the same kinds of human operation.  They all concern questions
of fact.  I never could understand how we ever got to thinking we have
questions which are not questions of fact.  We say, “Oh, that’s a question of
opinion.”  What do we mean?  Well, we can mean several things, but we usually
mean we don’t know enough about it yet to identify the principles, so we have
to guess on very light evidence, on a hunch as it were.  Or, if you are talking
about women, you would call it intuition.  But they act on the evidence, and
necessarily so.  They are just much better at it than men, and much more
frequently erroneous, of course.  For thousands of years, they had to make up
their minds instantly when they met somebody in the woods.  That was an
unfortunate example.  Maybe I ought to stop this thing.  Suppose you are a
delicate <i>[cave] </i>lady and meet <i>[a cave man]</i>.  You have to do
several things correctly and quickly.  With only the slightest indication of
his behavior, you have to decide whether to run like the dickens or to try to
vamp him or to try to avoid or fool him.  Men have something of that experience
too, but within greater limits.  They learn more slowly and are more
deliberate, or at least time-consuming, in their judgments.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            We frequently have to make
judgments on very slight evidence, do we not?  Sometimes after extremely long
and careful consideration we still are so deficient in the facts at hand within
comprehension that we have to make an extremely tenuous guess, we say.  And the
fewer the facts, the more apt we are to make the wrong judgment.  But we are
acting, note, as a scientist.  We are adding up evidence and drawing
conclusions, the conclusions being a generalization that we then apply to the
immediate matter at hand.  And if this singular application doesn’t work, we
change our hypothesis, whether it be “philosophical” or “scientific.”  ....</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            There are several
attributes of what we generally call science in the factual sense which it is
presumed are not true of philosophy, but they are.  One is that you can’t
repeat because you can’t control conditions, you can’t experiment as in a
physics laboratory.  But it is also true that you can control some things
better in human relationships than in a physics lab; you can repeat more nearly
one particular sequence in human affairs than you can in physics.   You can
repeat the rate of national income over and over again, going through the same
operation counting the same things, with appreciable confidence, much more
accurately than you can control and repeat the release of mesons from an atomic
structure in a cyclotron.  You can control the determining conditions.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The determining conditions
of national income are much wider in scope, and the theory of probability is
much more definitively applicable, because of the greater number of items which
make up your aggregate estimate than one electron.  It is much more
controllable.  The two do not differ on that score, do they?</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            <i>[Consider]</i> the
question of opaqueness.  Physicists and physical scientists operate constantly
with such constructs as time.  How opaque is time?  How verifiable is time? 
What does it look like?  Opaqueness means you can look at it; you can sense
it.  Well, I can sense anger much more easily than I can sense time.  And I can
count sacks of flour and hours of labor, and--bless my heart--even pain much
more confidently than I can sense time.  The physicists now define time as the
sequential relationship of events and/or objects.  That is to say, time is
time, whatever it is.  Very frequently that trick is pulled, you see.  In all
analysis, when you encounter something that you don’t quite know what to do
with, you say it in one word, and then in ten words, and then you’ve got it. 
That is the dictionary operation, and it is useful because it frequently stirs
up some cogitation.  It may lead you to investigations that will permit you to
explain.  But dictionaries themselves are not very helpful in explanation.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Well, what is time?  My
point is that science deals with things that aren’t opaque and philosophy deals
with things that are.  ....  It may be said that philosophy deals with ends,
and economists frequently say, “The ends belong here, and we have no concern
with them.  We are just concerned with how you get those ends.”  I’ll bet one
third of economic theory textbooks start out that way, and then tell you what
ends you ought to have and why they are valid.  But you can’t explain means
without ends.  They are understood either tacitly or explicitly, and any
student of recent American philosophical developments understands there is no
distinction between means and ends.  The whole of human experience has been
with the continuum.  No one has ever arrived at any end.  Things never stop,
they happen.  We have never had any experience with cessation.  There are ends
of particular things, lo, even of you and me.  But you make a pretty good humus
for poppies, and “every hyacinth that the garden wears dropped in her lap from
some once lovely head.”  You may stop smiling or grinning or fighting or
loving, but so far as we know the whole of human experience has been of unceasing
process.  There is no opaque evidence to the contrary, and there are countless
billions of evidences denying the end of anything.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            So far as we can tell, we
are concerned with processes and causal relationships between them.  It is
simple and obvious in most instances, as when you play marbles you apply
pressure and release it and the marble shoots away.  But it is harder to sense
such process with value judgments; it is less opaque.  An idea is a fact, but
not like a brick or a goose.  You may call it an opinion or something, but it
is a peculiar kind of fact.  What kind?  Well, you get into various attributes
such as lack of opaqueness.  But time is not opaque.  Neither are weight or
velocity or color.  All organized bodies of inquiry are concerned with facts. 
And some factual things are opaque and some are not.  And so, in this course we
shall proceed as if, when we ask a question, we are questioning facts.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'><b>lecture 4</b></p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'><b>            </b>I would like for us
now to consider the relation between value theory and social analysis.  I
suppose that the relation is fundamentally obvious and simple, after you
identify what you are looking for in the theory of value.  That theory
identifies the criterion of judgment, that in terms of which you choose between
alternatives.  But that is simply an identification of what it is; that does
not help you too much in working out the theory of value except in the sense
that you can’t work out a theory without identification.  ....  What we want to
know or what we want to get in view of in this course, what is the criterion of
judgment in fact?  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            I indicated already that
there is some debate about whether that question is a question of fact.  It is,
I indicated, the point at which most distinctions between normative and
positive take shape.  Things having to do with value are being considered
normative, and being considered in some sense or other not practical.  That
distinction, in any of its dozens of forms, is related to the distinction
between what is and what ought to be.  And I would like to say a few things
about that particular problem.  It is not worked out in the literature, and I
think we ought to look at it very carefully, because you cannot understand the
factual character of the referent for value theory unless you get this relationship
in mind.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            It would seem from reading
the literature and from listening to spokesmen that the relationship between
what is and what ought to be is the relationship between the run of the facts
and what someone wishes the run of the facts were.  Or what someone thinks the
run of the facts ought to be which, of course, presupposes a theory of value to
begin with.  Thus you get into a sort of tight little circle which I think is a
stumbling block to most of the more advanced thinkers who have been concerned
with this problem of value.  Furthermore, it seems to me (and I have a guilt
complex about it because it seems fairly simple and completely obvious) ...
that our difficulties for the most part have been semantic in their immediate
origin, and then work out into blockages of various sorts.  So I urge you to
consider the area on your own very carefully.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The run of the facts
involves ... all of the items in the continuum under consideration which are
causally related in causal sequence in the process, any one stage of which is
causally related to each preceding stage and chronological sequence.  ....  The
continuum in social affairs at all points involves purposeful human behavior:
choices are, in fact, made, which is the exercise of valuation.  That is to
say, there is an application of the theory of value at all those points.  And
those points are all points at which human beings engage in consciously
purposeful behavior, at which judgments and choices are made.  That is the most
obtrusive fact in the run of the facts about human behavior, more obtrusive
even than Veblen’s habituation, because it is more nearly constant.  Habitual
behavior is by definition not obtrusive, it is already known and does not
divert or excite opinion. It is a matter of course which you can anticipate
because of the established habituation.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            But at all points at which
judgments are made, however minute, however inconsequential, ... there is the
fact of the exercise of judgment and the application of value theory.  Now you
can see what I tried to prepare you for when, some days ago, I took the
position that there is no criterion of judgment in fact applied which is
different than the correct theory of value, taking the position that that would
be a paradox if it were<i> [not]</i> true.  ....  We are asking what in fact
people use as the criterion of judgment in social affairs.  We are not asking
what people ought to use.  We are not raising the question of creating a
universe to fit the specifications of the theory.  We are here asking what
people do in fact use as the criterion of judgment.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Already it seems quite
clear that every person does in fact use a criterion of judgment, because every
person does in fact judge very frequently.  Now most students of the problem
have got that mixed up with accuracy, and have accuracy mixed up with science
and the scientific method.  And for some very clear reasons.  But you can make
mistakes scientifically, and you can make mistakes in your value judgments,
without which there is no science and which mistakes will lead to constant
error.  So there is some peculiar relationship between value theory and the
accuracy of judgments in the application of the theory.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            But I want you to see
first that we are asking what in fact people do use in making value judgments. 
And here is where I differ most radically with the more able scholars in the
field, and somewhat self-consciously because of the terrific contributions and
accomplishments of these persons, particularly John Dewey and C.E. Ayres.  You
recall that I took the position some days ago that there is only one criterion
of judgment that is used or ever has been used or ever can be used in making
value judgments.  The most you can say to the contrary, I think, is that
persons have tried to use other criteria.  There can be no effective and
causally determinate use of other criteria if there be such a thing as value in
fact.  If there be such a thing in fact, it is an attribute of human judgment. 
It would be a paradox to say people apply other criteria.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            I think this is the
blockage in the work of the best scholars in the field.  It seems still to be
true in the thinking of John Dewey (after bowing down three times in that
direction to be sure we recognize his dominance.  And I mean that
instrumentally.)  He has done more than any other living man, but it seems to
me he is simply mistaken on the matter, and has convinced Ayres to the same
effect, that there is no paradox at all in the position that people in fact
apply the wrong criterion of judgment and, at the same time, that the criterion
of judgment is a question of fact.  It’s like the classical theory that all
deviations from what they prescribe as the universe under investigation are
exceptions to something.  Exceptions to what?  Well, exceptions to the universe
under consideration.  Are they not part of that universe?  Of course they are. 
</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Now, Mr. Dewey is quite
right about his identification of that criterion and its character.  But it
seems to me that he blocks us in our efforts to interpret what he says about it
by admitting for consideration the possibility of other criteria being in fact
used, in fact applied, and then to say the criterion is something else.  I
submit that that is a genuine paradox and therefore impossible.  That is to say,
they can’t both be the case at the same time.  To exclude something from the
universe that is admittedly part of that universe is a paradox.  What happens
is that we try to apply something other than the criterion and thus make
mistakes that we would not make if we didn’t.  We would still make mistakes in
applying the correct criterion, but they are different from the mistakes that
arise from application of the wrong criterion.  There are other origins of
error in judgments than the criterion.  The importance of the criterion in that
respect is this, it seems to me: it is involved uniformly in all judgments, and
thus if it is in error, all of your judgments are in error when you try to
apply them except by some sort of accident.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Now, back to my positive position
in the matter.  It is impossible to apply an erroneous criterion.  The question
of value is a question of fact: what is the criterion of judgment.  ....  It is
a fact that people think certain things ought to be, and they think certain
criteria of judgment ought to be used.  The criteria they try to use may not in
fact be the criteria that are applicable.  If a criterion isn’t applicable, it
can’t be applied.  So we avoid the paradox that might be stated as the
application of something which has been proven inapplicable.  ....</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Now I want to repeat
myself often in this course ... to help you work through what might strike you
as troublesome in your reading, as something wrong when the analysis proceeds
as if you were considering what people are applying which is inapplicable. 
....  The inquiry can most fruitfully be approached by trying to find out how
persons try to apply an inapplicable theory of value and, if inquiry reveals
that they in fact apply a criterion of judgment, we have to admit that it is
applicable.  ....</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            It turns out, if I am
correct about it, that what in fact happens is that we frequently try to apply
a theory of value which is inapplicable, which is untrue, and thus come out
with the wrong answers that fail to solve the problematic situations with which
we are confronted in the social area.  So the first point I would like for you
to get in mind is that our analysis should proceed as an inquiry into something
that is, in fact, there: what criterion is used in judging among alternatives,
remembering that we are not permitted intellectually and integrally the luxury
of paradox, nonsense, or irrationality in our pursuit.  If we were, if it were
all a matter of predilection or desire, then there would be no point in your
coming here and allowing me to waste your time.  You already know what you
like, don’t you?  Most of us could answer that quite easily.  Most of us could
say, “The criterion ought to be what I say.”  That would make it just Jim
Dandy, wouldn’t it, if you used for the criterion of judgment just what I say,
and when the world wants to find out about anything, just use my opinion. And
presto bingo, it is done.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            But facts have a peculiar
persistence, even when they contravene our predilections.  And the fact of
valuation has no different persistence than any other facts.  They’re just like
a flat tire on your car: predilection or desirability are irrelevant to fixing
it.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            And so in this class, we
are not asking what the criterion of judgment ought to be.  We are asking what
is the nature of the criterion of judgment applied in choosing what ought to
be.  Now there is a question of fact.  That is to say, what ought to be is a
question of fact.  And we can make mistakes there just like in our
multiplication tables or anything else.  The difficulty is mostly semantic. 
The relation between the run of the facts and the ought-to-be-ness involved is
difficult but not complicated.  The criterion is a fact, and what ought to be
is a fact.  At any instant in anyone’s experience, the present existence of the
fact of judgment  is a present fact, even though that judgment be about a
future attainment.  The rational faculty in human behavior connects the present
and the future.  We know for certain that the future will become the present, and
our judgments now are questions of fact about a particular operation of
choosing among alternatives the functioning of which are projections in human
imagination into the future.  You can’t make a judgment in the past, in that
sense.  All judgments are connections between the present and the future; they
are hypothetical projections of choices within one’s area of discretion into
combinations which are not yet.  If the combinations exist now, you aren’t
making that judgment; it has already been made.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The question we are trying
to resolve here is what is in fact the criterion of judgment among
alternatives, and thus in the determination of some future human behavior in
relation to other human behavior.  And my position shall be that the error
involved in value theory is not the application of an inapplicable theory, but
rather efforts to apply a theory that cannot be applied, thus forcing judgments
exterior to the facts of the universe composed of the things chosen.  We shall
be asking ourselves what is in fact the criterion of judgment which is in fact
applicable, not in terms of application of that which is inapplicable.  .... 
We shall not speak of the application of the wrong theory of value, but of
efforts to apply the wrong theory plus wrong judgments which result from that
error.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            I shall take the position
that there is no escape from, and there has never been any application of, and
there cannot be an application of, anything but what is in fact the criterion. 
And again I warn you about the semantic difficulties involved, because the
ordinary presentation of our problem at this point is so sloppily done: that by
“applying” the utility theory you get this answer.  We all talk like that,
don’t we?  Everyone who hasn’t had this course.  We say “in applying utility
theory,” under the assumption that it is a criterion of judgment and can be
applied.  Observed mistakes are not positive eventuations of actual
applications of a mistaken theory, they are eventuations of efforts to apply a
criterion which is in fact not a criterion and, therefore, the eventuations
from which are not in fact resolutions of the situation in which the
alternatives must be chosen.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Mistakes can arise in
applying the correct theory of value as well as in trying to apply incorrect theories. 
The position that once you have the correct theory you can go directly to the
solution of problems is wrong.  You are only half way there.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Now we have the problem
here, you see, of identifying the actual criterion which you are using all the
time, but you think you are using something else.  We mistakenly identify the
theory of value, and therefore the theory of valuation as well.  Our inquiry
must be into the rational determination of rational and irrational judgments,
their rational explanation and identification.  It is inaccurate to say “In
applying the utility theory of value,” but not “In trying to apply the utility
theory of value.”  ....  The two points I want you to get are:</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            1) Judging what ought to
be enters into the immediate run of the facts as an item in </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            the continuum of judgment;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            2) We must distinguish
trying to apply a criterion of judgment from actually and</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            effectively applying it.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            ....</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>STUDENT: <i>”It seem to me that
yesterday you were--maybe intentionally or not--getting at the point that,
although there can be only one theory of value, there may be various theories
of valuation which may be applied to certain universes of inquiry.”</i></p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            I should not have said--if
I did--that there can be one theory of value.  There can be any number of
theories of value, but only one correct, applicable theory of value.  In the
same way, there can be any number of theories of gravity, but whatever gravity
is, it is one thing which must be explained by a single theory.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Now in the relationship
between the theory of value and the theory of valuation, the best treatment of
which is John Dewey’s contribution to the International Encyclopedia of Unified
Science on that topic [<u>Theory of Valuation</u>, 1939], there can be any
number.  There must be as many theories of valuation as there are areas of
application.  How you go about measuring value or identifying comparative value
is determined by the things which you are comparing, is it not?  That problem
frequently arises and troubles students, and it involves recognition of the
difference in components of different kinds of problems.  Now, I think that it
should be possible to state the theory of valuation for any category of
problems which have sufficient genericy to permit common identification.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            For example, there should
be a theory of valuation in the totally inclusive sense--all valuation.  All
actions of evaluating have certain common attributes, otherwise you would have
no such category.  You could not speak of them as all being evaluative, or
actually attaining valuation.  Such a comprehensive theory would be inclusive
of the subdivisions of valuation.  The subdivisions will require different
statement but include the general theory.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            It has been argued that a
general theory requires a common unit of measurement for all problems, but that
is mistaken.  There is no common unit of measurement between the efficiency of
a telescope and the efficiency of an internal combustion engine.  The problems
involved in the functions of a telescope are not the same as the problems
involved in an internal combustion engine.  We measure the efficiency of the
engine by the ratio between energy input and energy output, meaning its energy
consumption in operation.  But we don’t measure energy consumption of a telescope. 
It performs a function of directing certain light rays in certain patterns, not
energy output functions.  So, we have a theory of the efficiency of
telescopes.  But if you try to measure efficiency in the same units and with
the same attributes when comparing two telescopes built for different
functions, you cannot ask the astronomer the question which is better, the Mt.
Wilson Observatory telescope--the 200 inch one--or the McDonald Observatory
telescope--the 100 inch one made for taking pictures.  He cannot answer.  Each
is best for its function--one for seeing great distances and the other for
taking clear-cut pictures.  There is no common unit of measurement or
comparison between those two instruments.  How can you compare accuracy of a
picture with distance?  I don’t know.  But both telescopes were built
scientifically, applying the instrumental theory.  If you try to choose parts
for a telescope non-instrumentally--meaning apply a non-instrumental
theory--you just don’t have a telescope.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            If you try to inflate a
flat tire--my favorite example--by blowing hard verbally, that’s the wrong
theory, you can’t apply it.  It won’t work.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            (I’m sorry I said that. 
This whole business of “work” has been so kicked around that it practically
doesn’t “work.”  I filled a tire with sand once, and it sort of worked.  You
can go places on it and it won’t destroy the tire; in that sense it “works.” 
But it doesn’t work nearly as well as air.  And “as well as” is what we are
trying to get at <i>[--judgments of relative effectiveness, of working better
or worse].</i></p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            <i>[Take the example of
the fascist.] </i> He’s got two theories which necessarily destroy each other,
so to speak.  He wants to kill everyone except those who agree with him, but
then he doesn’t have anyone to kick around, and that’s what he lives for--to
kick people around.  That’s the criterion of judgment of fascism: power.  Put
in vulgar terms, power means discretion over behavior of other persons, and it
doesn’t mean discretion in the sense of teaching them better ways.  It means
making them behave like you want them to behave, and that means kicking them
around.  Fascism is a validification of kicking people around with immunity. 
And the most efficient structure for that function culminates in one person, the
leader, the great man.  Otherwise, you see, the theory would be incomplete. 
That’s the only thing common to all patterns of fascism, but their function is
common and the institutions through which that function is performed depend on
whatever is available institutionally.  In Germany they used one set of
institutions and in Italy another.  But they all tried to perform the same
function, so that certain persons could kick other people around.  That’s why
they were so frightened of and hateful of the democratic idea, which is the
antithesis of fascism.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>STUDENT:<i> “Is ‘what is’ inclusive of
‘what ought to be?’”</i></p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Well, you are asking one
of two questions, and I’ll answer both.  Is “what ought to be” included in the
whole of “what is?”  Yes.  The valuation activity is included in “what is,” and
that involves the determination of “what ought to be,” or estimations.  It was
included in the classical theory in its early stages, and in Utopian social
analysis and anarchistic analysis.  The assumption of rationality in human
behavior.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Now the other question. 
Is “what is”  “what ought to be?”  Again, yes.  ....  The determination of
“what ought to” be is a constant part of “what is.”  It is the key to the
relationship between present and future affairs, and is therefore the focus in
analysis looking toward any inherently continuous development.  People are
rational in the sense that they can reason.  ....</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            This whole ancient
controversy between rational and irrational human behavior strikes me as
surprisingly naive.  It seems to me to be simple and obvious that humans behave
rationally in the sense of using reason to select alternatives.  They may make
mistakes, but they are exercising the capacity we call reason.  And they
exercise it where it is applicable, in choosing among alternatives.  In all
problematic situations we exercise reason to some degree, and that is a
constant situation in human experience.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Where it is not possible
to apply reason, we don’t apply it.  Where the problems have already been
solved and the response is repeated, we respond by habit.  You don’t have to
think about it.  The controversy has been on this level, “Are human beings
creatures of habit or are they rational?”  Why, heavens to Betsy, they are
both.  We use habit where habit is “useful”--which is nearly as bad<i> [as the
word]</i> “works” until we get the identification of value clearly in mind. 
Then it all becomes clear so that you can use “works” or “useful” meaningfully
thereafter.  We use <i>[these words]</i> where they functionally satisfy the
requirements of the situation at the moment.  And we use reason where <i>it</i>
functionally satisfies the requirements of the situation.  And that is not a
matter of choice.  That is a matter of fact, the determination of which is what
it is irrespective of your choices regarding that matter.  Habits are
applicable where solutions to particular kinds of problems have been attained
with sufficient accuracy to permit continued operation without serious
infringement of the continuum in question.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            We walk habitually.  We
put one foot in front of the other without considering the problems involved in
the process.  But when we first learned to walk, it was a terrific exercise,
one of the most exciting experiences that humans encounter.  Every time I
observe it, it strikes me with great admiration.  Here is a little fella, smart
as a whip and about that tall, usually around a year old.  He is watching other
folks, who seem to him about as high as that ceiling, walking around as if
there were nothing to it.  And he has a little brother or sister who runs
around all the time.  You learn to run before you learn to walk, you see.  You
find out later that you can do it at almost any speed you want.  Now it looks
like a desirable thing to do, and he figures out the theory pretty carefully. 
He tries it, and is admirably padded in the right places to give him the
possibility of repetition.  He does it over and over and the consequences are
about the same.  But watch him closely.  He figures it out a little at a time. 
He usually holds on to something, stomps up and down and kicks things.  Then he
pulls his leg up and puts it in every direction until he gets it out in front,
and then he grins.  By golly, he made it.  The “instinct of workmanship,”
literally.  Then he has another problem.  He’s got that other leg back there
behind.  Always got a problem.  So then he’s got to think it over.  And he
picks it up, pushes it around, maybe puts it down in the wrong place.  But
finally he get it out in front, and then he grins all over again.  And it just
exhausts him at first.  Then, when he solves it a couple of thousand times, he
gets to where he can sort of do it without thinking.  Then he stops thinking
about it and starts thinking about other problems.  Walking then becomes a
habit.  But in the initial establishment of the pattern, he had to solve a
problem with every move.  Now, he is built in such a fashion that he learns it
fairly easily, unless there is something wrong with him.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            That’s true of everything
we learn.  Watch a brand spanking new baby learning to suckle.  It is the only
way he can learn to eat very readily at that stage of his development.  But he
learns it right off the bat.  First the mother’s breast or an artificial
bottle: you put it in his mouth, and he doesn’t know what to do--just sort of
random behavior.  Then the mother or physician or nurse activates the muscles
around the mouth, and he gets it.  Then he really goes to town; it doesn’t take
him long--maybe thirty seconds, maybe a day or two.  But he learns pretty fast,
and it just tickles him pink--just the way you feel when you write a good
examination or do anything well that fits together, that solves a problem. 
Efficient relationship is established.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            We can call it (heaven
forgive me) “human nature.”  ....  Human nature in the sense that we don’t sit
down frontwards; we sit down backwards because we are built that way.  We learn
to walk fairly easily because we are built that way, even though the operations
involved in walking are terrifically complicated.  It just happens that we have
bifocal vision, and also semi-circular canals in our ears.  Little bubbles pass
over the cilia, giving you the position you are in, and you have to learn to
respect those bubbles.  At first, you have no respect at all.  Babies really
like standing on their head better than the other way when they are first born;
they have been doing it for nine months.  And even after they are a year old,
pick one up the wrong way.  He particularly likes that.  Everything upside down
amuses him and he likes it.  When he grows up, he won’t like this upside-down
business.  He is built that way.  And when he walks, all his muscles are
involved, while he constantly estimates different distances which permit him to
use the semi-circular canals in walking, to compare past experiences with what
is going on at present, the feel the pressure on various parts of the bottom of
his feet.  They tried experiments in which they made shoes that put pressure on
your toes when you stood back on your heels.  People did the darnedest things
you ever saw.  ....</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            A newborn baby learns
readily, and that requires working out the theory.  In some sense, he
establishes control of his nervous operations to direct the activities which
solve the problems at hand.  Humans constantly do that, choosing one pattern of
behavior as preferable to another, as more efficiently operative.  In that
sense, valuation is constant. It is the selection of proper behavior, choosing
among alternatives that are available in the sense that they may be chosen but
are not yet operative.  That selection determines which alternative becomes
operative, and that is the truth in the dictum, “Man is captain of his soul.” 
He determines the future through operations we call logic.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            All living beings operate
that way.  They also operate habitually in response to problems which have been
frequent enough to allow habituation to be established, and that necessarily is
far and away the larger part of our behavior.  If it weren’t true, there would
be no civilization.  If you had to figure out everything all the time, you
would never figure out very much because you would have to figure out the same
things all the time.  If you start at zero, birth plus one hour, what is your
situation?  Well, you’ve got to figure out the theory, as it were.  you’ve got
to learn to suckle.  Then you stuff yourself and go to sleep, after burping a
time or two.  Then you wake up and start yelling to the high heavens for the
nurse or any similar source, and you want to eat.  But you’ve got to figure it
out again, how to suckle, until you get the habit.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            That’s what jars the
intelligent conservative at any suggestion of change; he gets the sense that
you are going to disrupt his habits and do him some harm.  His reaction usually
comes from repeated experience of harm done by efforts to apply the wrong
theory.  And you can easily realize how an intelligent person could form that
habit of response in a situation in which the theory of progress has not been
worked out sufficiently well to make it available to the community at large. 
He will recognize the inadequacy of the theory, and habitually distrust
proposals of change.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            And so, young radicals and
most heterodox folks are inclined to believe that conservatives are by nature
stupid.  They aren’t at all.  And you will note a tendency on the part of
Disraelis to be conservatives much more than Blackstones.  Blackstone never had
the experience of constant repetition of mistakes like Disraeli.  It takes a
very good man, we say, to be raised on the wrong side of tracks and not be a
conservative.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The whole idea of what
generates heterodoxy is in error.  ....  It comes from the Marxian idea that
the underdog will rise up and shatter the overdog and then, depending upon what
school of Marxism you belong to, there will be only one kind of dogs--middle or
over or under.  Proponents of heterodoxies almost always come from groups which
have had fortunate experiences in the form of abstention from repeated error as
aberrations of the established order.  They never come out of the underground. 
No Frenchman of any intellectual stature in the heterodoxy sense ever came out
of the Apaches.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Now, it is true that the
great leader, the great thinker, comes out of the underground, and he comes out
so seldom because it takes a great mind constantly to encounter repeated error
and not become extremely conservative.  And most of us are not equipped that
way.  Consequently, the leaders come out of those who have not been
overburdened with repeated error.  They are not afraid to examine possible
variations.  You will find revolutions are not led by men from the other side
of the tracks, and the men from the other side of the tracks who follow them
don’t go with them on heterodox terms.  They go on some orthodox terms.  What
do you think the religiously heterodox are doing in the declining period of the
feudal era?  The most conservatively patterned groups in any society are in the
poorest communities.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'><b>lecture six</b></p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>STUDENT: <i>“Is knowledge the same
thing as theory, since it functions to bring order out of confusion.”</i></p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            ....  No, in that the two
terms are usefully separate.  We can’t interchange the two without losing some
cutting edge of either.  Theory I think we talked about sufficiently to
understand what we meant by that symbol.  Knowledge, of course, is involved in
all theory.  But I think the community, along with John Dewey, uses “knowledge”
as a symbol for particular items at whatever level: you can have knowledge of a
theory, the theory can be knowledge, and items of which that theory is a
composite can be knowledge.  Note that Dewey’s title was <u>Logic: the Theory
of Inquiry</u>, not <u>Knowledge: the Theory of Inquiry</u>.  His effort was to
identify the functional operations of what we call knowledge in logic as a
theory of inquiry.  Dewey’s thesis is that you have knowledge only in that you
have theoretical operations appertaining to the items of which you have
knowledge.  That is to say, only in so far as you can place it causally in the
continuum of which it is a part.  That placement is what we call knowledge.  It
involves comprehension of the causal relationships with other items in the
continuum of which it is a part.  And that, of course, is an operation of
theory.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            So theory and knowledge
are separately identifiable, but they are not separate in operation.  Just like
goats and kids: you can identify them separately, but you can’t have either
without the other.  And so if you use the terms interchangeably, you lose the
cutting edge of both.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>STUDENT:<i> “Dewey said that the
reason for growth of the idea of two kinds of reasoning is judging things out
of context with the whole.  Now you have just said knowledge is the proper
placement within the continuum, thereby sort of ...  The two types of reason
then become what?  Lack of knowledge?”</i></p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            That is an example of the 
difference between statement of various applicabilities of theories of value,
as Dewey put it--and as I think it should be put.  You see, if you think of
theories of knowledge as generic in any sense other than as claims to
explanation, you get into the dilemma  ... of investigating the application of
non-applicable theory.  The two types of knowing and of reasoning that Dewey
talks about are reflections of that confusion, as is Ayres’s questions--which
he stays not to answer-- “Can you know something that isn’t true?”</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            If you grant that you can
know something that isn’t true, you assume a sort of impossibility of
resolution in terms of sharp, specific identification of the theory of value. 
That implies two kinds of knowledge, knowledge #1 involving theoretical
comprehension of causal relationships, and knowledge #2 which is non-causally
related, separated from the universe.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            An example: “Art for art’s
sake.”  “If eyes were made for seeing, then beauty is its own excuse for
being.”  ....  This is the difficulty Dewey gets into (if I may criticize
Professor Dewey, and I may) with various applications of value theory.  “If
eyes were made for seeing,” then beauty couldn’t be its own excuse for being. 
There can be no such thing as self-contained meaning.  You can’t say “Beauty is
its own excuse for being,” without giving an excuse outside of beauty, like
eyes.  The poets--and heaven knows we allow poets things we won’t allow anyone
else--even the poets cannot be permitted complete nonsense.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The effort at independent
identification of anything is beyond the realm of social theory.  I do not
question the private experience, non-communicable and non-social, of anybody. 
That is your business.  I would object to any effort to infringe upon that.  
But I do think that it is literally and exactly impossible to know something
independently of everything else.  You can believe something on quite other
grounds in private comprehension--knowledge #2--but you can’t operate socially
on any other grounds.  You may operate between yourself and God, whatever you
conceive that to be--and I suppose there are as many conceptions of God as
there are people who conceive it--but you can’t operate with me on those
grounds because when you operate with me, it means communication, and you can’t
communicate those things.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            What we are concerned with
here, of course, is social value, and I take the position that the knowledges
which are operationally active in social behavior  are necessarily of the
knowledge #1 type, not knowledge #2.  If you grant applicability to knowledge
#2 that isn’t true, you claim applicability for inapplicable theory.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>STUDENT: <i>“You raised the point of
Ayres’s example [in <u>The Theory of Economic Progress</u>] of mechanics [making]
instrumental choices of tools, and the tendency of people to say they prefer a
certain tool. Then he went on to say that art can be instrumentally evaluated,
but the tendency was for people to evaluate it in terms of  autobiography.  I
was never clear on establishing the instrumental validification of art in other
than autobiographical terms.  ....”</i></p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            What Ayres points out
seems to me to be true.  Very frequently two kinds of problems are confused in
the aesthetic experience, which is always involved in the fine arts.  One is
autobiographical, while the other is the art item itself.  When you say, “I
like this picture as compared with that one,” you can be saying either of those
two propositions.  You can be saying you’re the kind of guy in whom desirable
responses are aroused by that sort of picture, which is autobiographical.  Or
you can be saying one picture is better than the other.  Both propositions are
genuine, but they are different and unrelated as operations in aesthetics even
though expressed in the same words.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            ....</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Art may be of two
kinds--creative and non-creative.  Both have the common function of expression,
as distinct from the crafts.  Crafts are involved in all art, but art means
expression, I think, to all artists.  The creative artist is one who conceives
things others have not yet conceived or seen.  He creates things and then
presents them to you.  He may be a sloppy craftsman.  Many of the greatest
artists have been pretty sloppy painters, as many of the greatest composers have
been sloppy musicians.  And frequently the non-creative artist is a craftsman,
but a craftsman in communication.  That’s what makes him an artist.  A creative
artist is a craftsman in communication who creates something for you to see
even if it is a simple picture with a narrow audience.  ....</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Great art means greatness
in comprehension.  That is why we say of some of the poorest craftsmen that
they were great artists.  Especially along about the 15th century when they
first began to get hold of permanent pigments, linseed oil.  And, gosh, they
got good.  They had been storing up things they couldn’t accomplish with other
media, and they turned loose and really went to town.  And we are doing it now
again.  Example: perspective.  No depth to early pictorial art, no matter what
the conception.  Finally, an artist saw how to get depth--one building looks
bigger than another, but it looks littler than I am and the other looks bigger
than I am.  Great stuff.  That’s the function of an artist.  He is a teacher.  All
creative art is teaching, but not all teaching is creative art.  ....</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Now, invention is the
combination of existing tools.  That is Ayres’s thesis: invention is
combinations of existing conceptual and physical tools.  This seems to me to be
incomplete and not too useful.  The fact seems to be that invention may also be
not combinational but extensional, linearly extensional, not compositionally
extensional. ....   Ayres doesn’t say what I’ve just said because he was
concerned with erasing the fallacy that invention is a matter of human genius,
springing out of creative potency with no relation to anything but genius.  He
was so intent on erasing that fallacy that he couldn’t quite grant what seems
obvious to me that we do, in fact, create without combination.  We conceive new
forms which are modifications, not combinations, of previously existing forms. 
Modification in reference to the function of an item, not in reference to other
items which have the same or other function.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            ....  It appears that people
learn all of their knowledge #2 about the age of 50.  They can’t learn past
that age because they get it completely comprehended and there is nowhere to
put anything new.  But with knowledge #1, the more you know the more you can
learn.  The more you can comprehend additional to what you now
comprehend--witness John Dewey and Albert Einstein.  With knowledge #2, the
more you learn the less there is left to learn.  It obstructs itself because it
is not continuous, it fills in, it stops.  It isn’t knowledge because it has no
possible verification in the sense of truth.  Truth is inseparable from
continuity.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Now we will have reason to
examine two meanings of continuity and, within those, get at the theory of
knowledge itself.  It is related to the relation between social analysis and
value theory in that, if we are prepared to understand such a simple thing as
“what is social value?” we will be prepared to understand it as knowledge #1
and knowledge #2.  ....</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            But I will have no further
concern with knowledge #2.  To hypothecate propositions which you know
beforehand are impossible is to talk nonsense--the application of inapplicable
theory.  Knowledge is whatever it is, and you can hypothecate alternatives
conjecturally, which is completely proper, as hypotheses leading toward
critical examination of alternative formulations looking toward discovery of
what is in fact true, what is in fact knowledge, what is the operation to be
called knowledge.  But you can’t discover that it is two different things at
the same time.  Hypotheses of that character can be useful only in so far as
they lead you to what is in fact true.  What we want to find out is what is
correct, not “what I wish were true.”  What you can find out inquiring into
what you wish were true is the effects on what is in fact true of wishing that
something were true.  Again you have two different kinds of problems, one
biographical and the other extra-biographical.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Knowledge is knowledge
#1.  You cannot in fact apply knowledge #2 in social analysis, there is no such
thing.  And the evidences are more complete than that the sun will rise
tomorrow.  That is to say, we can operate on them with greater confidence in
applying the theory of probability than we can act upon the hypothesis that the
sun will rise in the morning.  When you apply a knowledge, in the sense of
making it a functional part of a continuing operation, that is knowledge #1. 
You may use it for the wrong purposes, but what you apply is
interrelationships, not isolated identification.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            No.  That is an important
matter which you are getting at.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            What happens is this.  You
apply a theory, part of which is correct--not which is in part correct.  You
cannot apply a theory which is partly incorrect.  the “partly incorrect”

work down from more inclusive theory toward theory applicable to restricted
universes you can dissociate, as far as your conscious apprehension is concerned:
the theory which you are applying and the basic theory which you hold or think
you hold.  For example, you can start with a theory of value which you may be
able to present in a fashion which seems to you to be complete and
satisfactory.  As you work down toward applicability to, say, the problem of
eating breakfast, you can completely dissociate what you are applying from the
basic theory, an application of which is several degrees removed.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            You see, there are
inclusive theories, the principles of which are supposedly applicable to all
human experience: philosophical principles.  We apply these principles or
philosophical theories to broad or inclusive subdivisions of human experience
the inquiry into which we have advanced.  Generally, they are physical science
and social science, and each of these is divided into a large number of
disciplines.  Universities typically operate at these top two levels.  Below
that are applied fields such as engineering, and below that, the trades.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Each science discipline is
made up of a body of theory which seems to have no relationship to the others,
and which sometimes seems to operate under a distinct theory.  You will find a
person here and a person there operating through the application of different
theories.  You often hear, “Well, that may be true from the historical point of
view, but from the economic ... or sociological ... or psychological
standpoint, it is quite different.”  What is quite different?  All they are
saying is that sociology and economics are different, not that what you are
talking about is different.  So it seems to me to follow that either one or
both of the two disciplines is operating under an erroneous theory.  .... 
Naive physical scientists also think their disciplines are equally separated. 
It was once thought that biological principles and chemical principles had
nothing to do with each other.  Then we got into a whole area of inquiry which
seemed to require being set aside for deliberate investigation, and we called
it biochemistry, by which we mean complicated chemistry.  And the principles
involved there can do no violence to chemical principles, or one or the other
is wrong.  There is in fact unity of the facts and, therefore, unity of
knowledge and, therefore, unity of theory in so far as it is applicable.  .... 
It often happens that we apply the correct theory, but call it something else. 
We have been talking the utility theory of value for about 6000 years, and we
have been applying something quite different all the time!</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            ....  I used to amuse
myself by kidding my physical science friends about the independence of
physical and social sciences.  If you ask them the right questions, you finally
get them to decide that enzymes are purely a figment of the imagination,
although they have isolated them and weighed them and had them in tubes.  The
problem you get the scientists to see is that they are concerned with a
philosophical problem that has to do with “stuff,” with matter you can bite and
pinch and throw on the floor.  It’s a problem of identification and
comprehension at the philosophical level.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            What is wrong with their
comprehension?  What has dictated the current comprehension of an enzyme? 
Well, Newton’s laws, one of which, for example, says “all physical change
involves a release of energy.”  All chemical change, which is a particular
category of physical change, is the same thing.  But enzymes don’t behave that
way; they are outlaws.  They have a lot of consequences, and you can’t live
without them.  But you develop them without the release or absorption of
energy.  In recent years that gave Dr. Einstein considerable concern, and he
came to doubt his General Theory of Relativity by virtue of that fact, among
others.  He has in fact questioned its fundamentalness, generality, and
foundation (not the accuracy) because of that phenomenon.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            It’s quite clearly a
question of the criterion of judgment that becomes paramount at the border of
human understanding--when you are working creatively toward discovery,
invention, extended comprehension, addition to civilization--what we ought to
mean by research.  Everybody does research, but we have certain ceremonially
identified behavior that we specifically call research--when you go to a
university and get certain wiggly marks to put after your name, but not when
you are just out in a field plowing.  Not so strangely, the perpetual wailing
of graduate students is that the staff won’t let them do <i>[research]</i>. 
They make them go back and emphasize what the staff has said, which gives them
the idea that the teaching staff is using them as an advertising means, and
that if you do anything differently, and especially in addition, it’s sort of
an insult because, certainly, staff ought to have known it.  But didn’t know
it, and so you feel squelched.  In a sense, at the very spot where organized
inquiry in the creative sense is supposed to be the sole function, we sort of
don’t allow it at all, but will allow it anywhere else.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            That’s not so strange as
it may seem.  We have always talked one way and acted another, necessarily so
in so far as we have theory anywhere along the line between general theory and
application.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            In social science, there
are some distinctly different kinds of problems, but not different principles. 
The problems are different because of the attributes of human beings.  Among
the things that permit us to identify the category “human being” is organized
theory, and thus the capacity to teach, the capacity to do fine arts and
sciences, the ability to find out theory and transmit it to other members of
the species.  That is peculiarly human.  Other species work out simple
theories, but can’t teach them to others.  ....</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Our terrific advantage is
that we can communicate theory and thus apply it to a problem effectively, and
thus solve problems much more easily than any other species.  That’s why we
have civilization and other species don’t.  We accumulate know-how as a
species.  We teach our young everything, while other species can only show
them.  Students with the advantage of the conclusions created by all previous
experience can proceed to apply that theory and extend human experience in an
amazing fashion.  No other species can do that.  ....</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Differences among theories
are not differences in whether principles that apply at one level also apply at
other levels.  Principles at one level cannot violate principles at another
level.  It doesn’t make any sense to distinguish between the applied sciences
and the pure sciences.  The scientific process proceeds by a constant shuffling
back and forth in terms of corroboration and reformulation and correction and
extension.  The supposition most frequently has been that a principle applied
in physical science is different when applied in social science, one being
scientific and the other not. Not really evidential, a matter of choice.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            There is a matter of
choice, in the sense that social theory is about choice-making things--humans. 
The real difference between physical and social science is the kinds of
phenomena investigated.  Humans are by their very nature choice-making things
so, in human affairs, making choices becomes a matter of justice.  There is no
justice between one molecule and another, but there is justice between one
person and another.  ....</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The theory of justice, and
I think this is as old as human thought, always takes one form, with the back
door open in the form of another ancient human myth.  The form the theory has
taken I have been calling the equational theory, in which something is brought
into equality or balance with something else, and thus justice is done.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            That theory is not true,
has nothing to do with justice and is, therefore, inapplicable.  Efforts to
apply it lead to the back door claiming that justice is done by fate.  When it
becomes clearly demonstrable in any particular instance that the so-called
equational theory of justice is not applicable, we say it is just fate--perhaps
the oldest of human myths.  You can always use it as the back door to escape
anything you are unwilling to face, especially if you are a coward, if you
prefer to avoid rather than to understand.  That’s where making fun of people
comes from, the moron’s defense of name calling.  Once you have said fate, you
have excused yourself from comprehension.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            In most of our experience
we insist, for reasons Veblen was trying to get at in <u>The Instinct of
Workmanship</u>, on understanding all that we can.  We insist on exercising our
capacity to reason as much as it is applicable.  Ordinary human experience
frequently doesn’t provide sufficient opportunity for the reasoning activity of
problem solving, so we create the need for reasoning.  We may sit at a bridge
table and have an elaborate system of creating problems that require judgments
about who, what, where, and when.  We try to solve them, and measure
comparative efficiency with invidious differentiation of a score.  We’re built
that way, in the same sense that we can’t sit down backwards.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The problem of justice is,
I think, the weakest area in general social theory at the moment.  What we have
been conceiving justice to be has been what I call the equational theory.  A
man pays his debt to society, and we say justice is done; an eye for an eye and
a tooth for a tooth.  In personal relationships, we apply it all the time: “He
did so and so to me.”  What do we say?  “I’ll get even with him.”  And when you
do, you feel all right; now justice is done.  Of course, Jesus came along and
said he didn’t think that was the case.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            What is price theory if it
isn’t an equational theory of justice in the economic process?  It is a
demonstration of justice when price equals cost, when reward equals
contribution.  How else could the theory parade as a demonstration of justice
in any particular institutional structure, for example, the market process?  We
all say--but the socialists especially--that persons ought to be paid in
proportion to their contribution.  We say that, but we don’t act that way at
all.  We couldn’t solve the problem of carrying on the economic process that
way.  Note the Marxian theory traveling on the same proposition.  The whole
theory of exploitation involves the notion that it really belongs to somebody
else and that the capitalist gets it and so is exploiting the rest of the
community.  The capitalist is getting something that isn’t his, and that is
unjust.  He is getting more than he puts in; it’s unequal, and therefore
unjust.  And the whole theory of surplus value is a demonstration that he gets
something that he doesn’t contribute. Now offhand, that seems to me to be so
silly that it hardly requires consideration.  However, it is the most
prevailing, both laterally and chronologically and vertically as far back as
you can find a trace.  No one except a few lone deeply religious thinkers have
questioned it, and not many of them.  Confucius believed it, but Lao-tse
didn’t.  It is a stumbling block.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'><b>lecture eight</b></p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Last time I indicated that
there were two or three items which I wanted us to consider in the relationship
between social analysis and value theory, one of which we mentioned as the
equational theory of justice.  We mentioned its place in social analysis as
being somewise identified as the making of choices in relationships with other
persons, justice and rightness being very closely associated in our thinking in
a way which is inescapable.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            We encounter justice in
making estimates of two or more behavior patterns in relation to other
persons.  Some instrumentalists have tried to avoid the use of the word, and
get at the same thing with other tools.  If that be a valid procedure, then we
shall have to discover those tools.  I suspect it is in fact valid.  What I
would like to say about it is in contradistinction with the equational theory,
which it seems to me is a result of [attempted] application of the utility
theory.  And one of the items in the demonstration of the long and continuous
efforts to apply the utility theory of value is the unmistakably continuous and
unexceptional use of the equational theory.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            If it be true that the
equational theory of justice is a particular application of the utility theory
of value, and especially if it can be shown that it is uniquely and exclusively
correlated with it, and then if it be true that we have always applied the
equational theory in the matter of justice, then it would be considerable
evidence that the value theory we have tried to apply has been the utility
theory.  Then, the immediate question would be, is there a unique and exclusive
correlation between utility value and the equational theory of justice?</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Only slight reflection is
required to bring clearly to mind what we mean by “the equational theory of
justice.”  When we go about determining justice it is habitual to think of it
in terms of equating one thing with another.  What things?  Direct human
relationships, it seems to me. It is the matter of utility and disutility.  If
you cause pain or unhappiness by your deliberate behavior, then justice
involves imposing some form of disutility.  For example in the courts, if the
accused has already experienced a great deal of disutility, a lighter sentence
can be imposed to achieve justice; whereas, if no such experience has occurred,
then the court feels it must impose the maximum penalty.  ....</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            What is justice about? 
Well, we make people “pay for.”  We use that expression to mean what
neoclassical economic theory of the market process means by sacrifice in some
fashion equivalent of what you receive.  In fact, the epic significance of
neoclassical price theory is that it demonstrates the justice of the market
process by showing that utility and disutility are brought into equilibrium. 
Or, at least, it does as well as any other process can be conceived to do.  I
think it is completely uniformly applied in all cultures.  You do this for me,
then I am in some sense or other obligated to do that for you.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            You can see how that can 
have come about in human thought.  There is a matter of reciprocation involved
in human relationships.  The item of doing for each other constitutes
civilization, along with other things.  It is a necessary correlation, and the
matter of equivalence comes in easily.  But equivalence of what may be rather
difficult.  In legal theory, since psychological science has attacked the
hedonistic-calculus presentation of it, the situation of what is equilibrated is
pretty well bankrupt.  But something is always equilibrated.  Until and unless
and except in those instances in which a problem is simple enough that we can
see it clearly, and which must be solved--this applicability thing again--and
its determinants are clearly in view.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Like juvenile
delinquency.  We know pretty much about it.  We have the figures and the run of
the facts.  We have seen correlations between all sorts of variables like
income, health, caloric intake, literacy, housing, parents, etc.  Some of those
things are subject to our deliberate choice, and some communities have tried to
change those things with which there is a high correlation in terms of juvenile
delinquency.  Students are always doing that in term papers: going out and
looking at some of these correlations, then finding another community where
some items subject to choice are different, and describing that correlation. 
Where correlations vary, they conclude that one variable causes delinquency and
what we ought to do about it.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Now, what are they
equilibrating in such operations?  What are you equilibrating when you build a
slum clearance housing project?  You aren’t equilibrating anything!  And that
worries us no end.  When the Housing Act of 1937 was passed, it worried Congressmen
and people at large so  much that there didn’t seem to be anything to
equilibrate; it must be unjust.  So they got around it by sort of forcing
justice into it by making the remainder of the community pay for the project
over and beyond what rents were paid by the tenants, on the proposition that
the community would be done justly by virtue of two circumstances: 1) that
these people wouldn’t be so nasty, and thus would be nicer to have in the
community, and that would occasion less disutility to the nicer folks, and 2)
that the community (shades of Robert Owen, and a shadow of Clarence Darrow) is
in part responsible for the condition that these people are in and ought to pay
a little bit of it.  By virtue of these two circumstances, it became tolerable
to clear the slums through the use of other devices than purchasing power of
the tenants who lived in them.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Then, if you want to see
someone really get excited about the lamentable state of affairs, prove to
them--as is quite easily done because it is in fact true--that no one pays
anything for those projects.  Never have, never can.  There is no way to pay
for them.  No one sacrifices anything, everybody gains.  And, of course, that
doesn’t seem right.  Upon presentation of that proof, what else could bother
them?  Why should it disturb them so that everybody should gain?  It would seem
to me offhand that that would just tickle everybody pink. Oh, no!  That can’t
be.  As one of the largest bankers in America (now deceased) said to me upon
presentation of the evidence to an official body of which he was a member, “By
George, that’s unnatural!  That can’t possibly be.  Nature will force
recompense on the community, and it will do so through the market process.  And
if you’ll have lunch with me tomorrow, I’ll show you.  I can’t find it now, but
between now and then I’ll find it.”  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            We had lunch the next day
and he hadn’t found it.  He said, “I know that the market process will find you
out, that this project you want to build is going to cost somebody in the community
as much as you’re going to pay for it, and you’re darn sure going to pay all
its worth and they’re going to sacrifice that much.  I said, “fine.  You just
find one man who has less because this project is built than he would have had
without it, and I’ll say that that is his atonement for my sin.”  He worked on
that for about three months, and got to where he couldn’t sleep.  And we had
lunch together every day expecting him to disclose the discovery of how the
market process would bring about justice in construction of this project.  He
never could find it, and I think he died a very unhappy man realizing that
finally nobody pays for it.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Was that unjust?  Of
course it wasn’t.   Everybody sees that, but there is still something wrong
with it.  We set up our wage theory, do we not, on the basis that the marginal
disutility of working equals the marginal productivity produced by labor.  That
makes us feel pretty good; justice is done.  Man gets what he is worth.  As
Stephen Leacock said to Adam Smith in <u>The Helements of Economics </u>(if you
haven’t read that you must of course do so):</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Adam, Adam, Adam Smith,</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Listen what I charge you
with.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The worker’s worth just
what he got,</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            That’s what you said, was
it not,</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Adam Smith?</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            But what about a man or
woman doing something he likes to do?  Doing something he would do anyhow? 
Then is it unjust to pay him?  Don't we all envy those persons who love to do
what they are doing, who would do it for nothing?  And the rest of the
community--note many of the Quaker Colleges have--the rest of the community
have always thought they were rather queer.  They are a little bit “tetched in
the head” in some sense of other, because they don’t pay any attention to how
much work you do.  Some instructors are making ten times as much as full
professors, and everybody knows that a full professor suffers much greater
disutility teaching his class than an instructor.  An instructor’s soul had not
reached the point of development and his feelings are not so finely adjusted to
experience sufficient disutility.  We say he isn’t worth much.  They pay him
whatever he needs, and if he has spending money, they won’t pay him anything. 
And these guys go on working for nothing.  We think that is peculiar.  Of
course we know better.  It both pleases and displeases us to see injustice done
in that sense.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            And so you will find, in
all demonstrations of justice of any institutions in any culture, a loophole. 
And in economic theory it takes all sorts of forms.  In the last reformulation
of neoclassical theory it takes the form of the consumer surplus.  Here is a
very fortunate circumstance in which justice is done at the same time you get
injustice done through the realization of greater utility than disutility which
is occasioned by purchasing consumer goods.   Nevertheless, things exchange at
their true value, the utility and disutility are brought into equality.  And of
course that is no less true of the Marxian theory, in which you get a surplus
at the same time justice is done in that those who experience the terrible pain
of direct participation in the economy are receiving the rewards of that pain. 
We have other ways of talking about those things which are equilibrated, but I
would suggest that all of them are systems of valuation of the two basic things
which are in fact conceived to be brought into equilibrium in the attainment of
justice: utility and disutility, however conceived.  Such things as labor
theory of valuation, price theory of valuation, or anything else.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Note that in all cases
there is a concept causally anterior to these theories.  That concept is one of
human nature and one of nature itself which sets into motion, or at least is
composed of, forces which result in equality.  And that is why nature is
presumed to be “just.”  Everything that goes up, we say, is bound to come
down.  And that even works itself down to business cycle theory.  Nature is
that way.  You’ll pay for it, we say.  Human observation has disclosed that
sometimes that is not the  case.  So we catch them after they are dead and even
up the account.  Some systems do that in a very careful fashion so that the
books are balanced before the attainment of justice.  In some instances the
attainment of nothingness is the attainment of justice at complete equilibrium.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Now, if you are
approaching life from the direction of the Stoics, you would expect the final
attainment of justice to take that form.  If you are approaching it from the
direction of the Epicureans, you would expect it to take some other form.  Yes,
a balancing of the books, but after that, “Oh boy!”  Both rely on the same
concept of justice as equilibration.  Since these things are exactly opposite
and are brought into equivalence in terms of human impact, there is no
directional resultant when justice is attained.  And without the creation of
additional aberrations, especially if you are already dead, then you remain
perpetually in equilibrium and no more injustice occurs.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Now, we balance the books
as best we can before we kick the bucket.  We do it through institutions, and
we try pretty hard at it, even though it causes us no end of mistakes and
trouble.  We almost fight for the right not to apply any other concept of
justice than that one.  But we do apply another one if a problem is important
enough and its determinants are clearly in view.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            How would you solve the
problems of slum clearance or juvenile delinquency through an application of
the equational theory of justice?  Well, one possibility is applying the
neoclassical theory of price.   You could stop interfering and let the market
process determine it.  We did that until a public health officer in New York
pointed out that there was some correlation between health and slums, between
the cost of city administration and slums, between fire losses and slums,
between the level of taxation and slums.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Some people started
thinking seriously about the problem.  Now, if the people who live in slums are
mean, and you can’t control how mean they are but you have some control over
where and how they live, what are you going to do?  First make them good, then
they won’t live in slums and there won’t be any slums.  We worked at that for a
long time.  There were several societies organized directly looking toward the
elimination of such living conditions.  And it didn’t work; the slums got
worse.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            So we said, “Okay, we give
up on making these people good.”  We concluded they were naturally mean and
ought to live in slums--again, you see, equilibrating contribution and reward. 
But we still--and I would have you note this carefully in your thinking--could
not escape the consequences.  When a child in the worst slum of the meanest
parents, brattiest brat, gets the measles, your kids get them too.  There is no
escape from the consequences.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The truth of Ayres’s
dictum that any community any member of which is in any degree crippled, to
that degree cripples the community, cannot be made in terms of the equational
theory of justice.  That’s why we find it so difficult to accept and use
instrumental theory as a functioning concept of justice.  It does great
violence to an almost exclusively uniform theory.  What is just about it? 
Well, the efficient operation of the social process, because every loss of
efficiency of the economic process has inescapable incidences.  But that may
dictate all sorts of conclusions, all sorts of alternatives which would be
precluded by, forbidden by, the equational theory ...</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>              Where in the whole of
human experience, in so far as we have any evidences, do you find the
problematic situation solved by the application of the equational theory of
justice?  You find many problems solved, and you find people trying to apply
the equational theory.  But I think you will find that the problem is solved
irrespective of that effort at application.  A man commits a crime and we send
him to jail if he doesn’t have any other way of equating his sacrifice with his
purse--let’s say he isn’t rich.  But if you steal enough money to have enough
to pay for that great sin, then the judge will even shake hands with you,
maybe.  You hire a lawyer, pay a fine, and the community accepts it as
justice.  If you don’t have enough utility--meaning value, meaning exchange
capacity, meaning wealth--to recompense your sins, then you have to go to court
and to jail and suffer disutility.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            If you had applied the
efficiency theory of value to the problem, you might also put the one
committing a crime in jail, but for different reasons: to protect the community
from someone who can’t react correctly to problematic situations.  If you get
to where he is hitting you on the head, you can’t operate the community so you
restrain him from hitting.  You also must jail the person who has money to pay
fines, but continues to run through city streets at high speed, endangering the
lives of others.  You can fine him from now until doomsday and not solve the
problem.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            So long as the seeming
application of the equational theory of justice appears to solve our problems,
we continue to do it.  We love our mistakes especially.  However, we have
always known that the best that can be is the greatest aggregation of value
that can be realized.  And the miracle, as it were, of the more recent
utilitarianism, either in the form of price theory or in its 18th century form
of legal theory, is to reconcile the greatest value with the equational theory
of justice.  You get a surplus--in economic theory in the form of capital
accumulation--at the same time that justice is maintained and everything sells
at cost.  That is to say, at every stage, to every member in the economic
process, his return is no more than what he puts into it.  You get your just
deserts at the same time that the community attains a constant accumulation of
more and more, over and above what it uses up in attaining more and more.  That
is to say, over and above real economic costs.  And the miracle--and it would
be a miracle because it is simply impossible, it is in fact a paradox--is
brought about  not by application of the equational theory of justice, but by
granting discretion to those who can be justified by that theory.  If you
applied the equational theory consistently, you would have no theory of capital
formation.  So you either have to deny the theory or find some exception.  And
what we have done is find exceptions.  As Malthus pointed out, and I agree with
him, it seems “unbecoming” to have to explain almost all of the operations of
the economy as exceptions to what has been set forth as the fundamental
principles.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'><b>lecture nine</b></p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            I should like for us to
look at what seems to be the relationship between the utility theory of value
and the mores principle.  The purpose of this course, its instrumental function
in being centrally concerned with social values, is, I hope, to furnish you
with some way of going about analyzing social problems.  In doing so, the mores
principle is always involved, and recognition of that fact without recognition
of the relation between it and its many corollaries, brings about a
subconscious use of the utility theory--even by those who are conscious of that
theory’s difficulties.  What results, it seems to me--and especially in the
professional literature, is the creation of a bunch of clichés growing out of
applications of the mores principle.  Those clichés mean many different things
to different people, and thus obstruct communication and the attainment of
understanding.  It is one of those things, sort of a parallel case with
justice, we ought to try to get straight.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The first step, after
pointing out what the mores principle is, is to look at how it is involved in
our thinking about institutional problems.  You will note that it is never
stated, although spoken of and about, so its meaning may vary.  William Graham
Sumner’s effort at identification of the principle <u>[Folkways</u>, 1907]
seems to me to be very fortunate in its central content.  But others use it
with connotations foreign to and even antithetical to the principle which he
demonstrated.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The principle is, it seems
to me, that habits of action and thought constitute the established behavior
patterns of individuals and, therefore, constitute the structure of
institutions.  Or, identical in content and approximately in words, habits of
thought and action constitute established behavior patterns of individuals and,
therefore, constitute the structural members of institutions.  Or, institutions
are made of patterns of behavior we call habits.  Or the correlation of
behavior which constitutes institutions is habitual. That’s the mores
principle.  Now you’ve heard it stated.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            As some of you have heard
me say many times, the most frequent corollary which supposedly constitutes the
actual operating idea with which scholars have worked can be stated in this
fashion: “Habit determines institutional structure.”  There is a very great
difference between determine and constitute.  The word “determine” indicates
causal antecedence and direction and specification, that is to say,
“determination,” that habits “cause” institutions to come about.  That is about
the stage at which Thorstein Veblen left it, in so far as he discussed it
directly.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Institutions seemed to
Veblen to be the development of “incontinent habituation”--a very unfortunate
phrase.  Now Veblen worked at a very different concept but, never having stated
it, kept saying such things, as if institutions were in themselves nothing more
than incontinent habituation.  As a matter of fact, they usually are to the
individual.  But a very little reflection will reveal that the determination
side of it is not what has been proven in examination of the mores and
folkways, but habituation is not even possible in the determination of
institutions, the determination of course being a revelation of how they come
about.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The causal sequences
involved and the determination of a pattern of behavior--an institution--necessarily
require initiation, and usually involve an antithesis between this so-called
corollary and the mores principle.  Initiation requires purposeful behavior,
the making of a choice and, thus, the involvement of value theory.  The
constitution of the mores being habitual--commonly accepted, as we put it--they
could not determine the initial action.  And if it isn’t habitual, it dead
certain can’t be incontinent.  It involves making choices.  The initial action
requires choice and choice involves reason. Institutions are in fact initiated
out of actions which are themselves efforts to solve problems.  They are not
and cannot be incontinent habituation.  They become accepted only when they
become habitual.  Otherwise they would not have any prescriptive force, without
which we do not even allow a deliberate specification of a pattern to be called
an institution.  The coercive power of a dictator in any community, enforcing
behavior which is not accepted by the community, does not establish behaviors we
call institutions.  It is only when that specification is imposed successfully,
so that persons in fact act that way, that we permit ourselves to call it an
institution, when it attains the status of habituation.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Now we shall probably say
a great deal more about it, but this habitual business is the essential
character of institutions.  But it isn’t how they are determined, because they
are determined by behavior which, in its initial execution, is a matter of
choice.  Habit by definition is something which you do frequently enough to do
it without calculation; you don’t have to think about it to do it.  And that,
of course, constitutes behavior we call institutions.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Ayres senses some
disrapport, some antithetical relationship between the operating idea--the most
prevalent corollary--and the mores principle itself.  That’s why he never
states the principle, because he is operating with its corollary, and that
confuses his work.  ....  All due respects--and there are many--to Dr. Ayres,
whom I consider the maturest scholar alive, but he can be wrong and, in this
instance, he is.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>STUDENT:<i> “I know I don’t understand
what you mean by saying that he is operating with a corollary of the mores
principle.”</i></p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            I put it this way: habits
determine institutions.  That is the corollary with which most social analysis
proceeds, as if it were the mores principle.  What has been proven is not that
at all.  What has been proven is the principle as I stated it--that our
institutional behavior is habitual, and its prescriptive power ... is by virtue
of that.  Even where deliberately coercive power is applied for enforcing a
pattern of behavior which is not accepted, we will not call it an institution. 
It is that prescription through common acceptance ... which puts it in the
category of institutions.  Now, most of those prescriptions are of course in
other forms, frequently in written form, in the law and in ancient--meaning
beyond our memory--establishment of those dicta.  ....  But determination is a
very different matter than constitution, and the character of determination ...
couldn’t possibly be habituation.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Initiation is involved in
determination, and initiation can’t be habit because habit involves repetition
sufficient in number and frequency to allow behavior without calculation. 
That’s what a habit is.  You walk habitually.  Always there are new situations
which specify variations from the established pattern, and that is why no one
has ever been able to stop the roll of progress.  You can slow it down by the application
of coercive power, but can’t stop it because there has never been any way
devised to control the whole of human behavior through prescriptive use of
force.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            All institutions have
instrumental functions, but no institution was ever accepted by the whole of
society completely.  It may be accepted by every individual but only in part. 
That is why for the individual, institutions are given data.  He has,
instrumentally speaking, no choice of alternatives which are so far out of the
prevailing institutional structure that he contravenes the instrumental
operations going on through that structure.  No matter how dominantly
ceremonial an institutional structure is, you as an individual may create more
ceremony by going outside that dominantly ceremonial pattern.  Your problem,
and the problem to be solved where the institutional behavior pattern does not
permit the instrumental function which it is presumed to carry on, is to change
the institution.  But you can’t change an institution by going so far beyond it
that you create destruction, because when you stop the working function, you
also stop the instrumental function.  So you as an individual cannot neglect
proper behavior in the ceremonial sense if society is to survive.  The leeway
available to you is specified by observable facts, and they differ for each
continuum under consideration, for each problematic situation in  that
continuum.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            You can’t, for example,
ignore the opinions of your neighbors.  No matter how ill-chosen those opinions
are, you cannot violate them in the sense of going beyond what I shall later
identify as minimal dislocation and survive.  And society is correct in
forbidding you that alternative, because to take that alternative destroys the
society instrumentally--which is <i>[the bit of truth]</i> in the
arch-conservative position.  He is about 1/16 correct, but he has some sense of
something the revolutionary doesn’t understand.  The revolutionary is about 1/4
correct, which is more than the arch-conservative.  But the part about which he
is wrong is very important.  And failure to recognize it is why all revolutions
always have and always will fail.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            <i>[Conservatives also
always fail and always must.  They fail more readily than revolutionists

applicable.  In the American Revolution, there were great men involved, and by
chance they were thrown into policy enunciation.  Tom Paine, Ben Franklin were
saying, “All men are created equal, and we are going to set up institutions
that will work that way.”  So they set up the Articles of Confederation, which
simply said nobody is going to tell anybody what to do any time about anything
under any conditions.  It wasn’t that bad, of course, but they were pretty
nearly anarchists: “That governs best which governs least.”  That’s what
Jefferson said, and I don’t know how much better an anarchist could state his
position.  They won the battle with the help of the French and good weather and
a lot of other things.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            That is his position, and
it is dead wrong.  It grows out of the failure to comprehend clearly the
distinction between the mores principle and its corollaries by Smith, Commons,
and many other scholars.  His suggested compromise between revolutionary and
conservative positions comes out of the failure to comprehend a criterion of
judgment which permits you to judge.  Since you can’t judge, all you can do is
add it up and divide it by a number.  That’s Commons’s theory of agreed
compromise.  ....</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Without a criterion of
judgment, what else can you do?  If you have no way to calculate the range,
what do you do?  You find ten guys brave enough to stick their heads out and

can get.  No.  The failure of two positions doesn’t dictate a compromise
between them.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The leaders of the
American Revolution did sometimes compromise in the sense of Smith and Commons,
but it was not a reconciliation of their positions.  It was a hit-and-miss
effort, and wonderfully successful, in part.  But after the Articles of
Confederation, problems arose all over the place because they tried to apply a
theory that was inapplicable and created rather than solved problems.  ....</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            What is generally called
compromise means a little give and a little take; part of what you want I
accept, and part of what I want you accept.  The surrender of your dignity upon
the agreement that your opponent will also become a little undignified.  An
abandonment of what you think to be right if he will likewise sin.  That never
solved any problem anytime anywhere.  It begs the question of which thing you
abandon, and that is the determination of the answer.  Not how much but what,
and you can’t even see “what” in those terms.  That is evading the question. 
The whole idea of compromise is misleading .  You get the wrong answers if you

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Then I haven’t made myself

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            What I have been saying is
not that there is only one alternative, but there is only one correct theory. 
The function of theory is to lead you to available alternatives, and your
effort is to make the best choice, and that is how value theory enters.  Now, a
theory which is not applicable does not lead you to the available choices.  The
choices may be innumerable; theory is singular.  Whatever theory you try to
apply determines in large measure the data you gather.  That is part of its function. 
And the data you gather determine in a discernible way what alternatives are
brought into view among which you are to choose.  The whole idea of eclecticism
is a myth.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            You activate yourself in
trying to apply the theory to the problem in this wise: You gather the
pertinent data in accordance with the theory.  Now, if the data you gather are
not determinate of the problem, then your concept of application has to be
changed or it isn’t being applied.  It seems obviously true that what we mean
by wrong theory is theory which does not lead you to the alternatives upon
which resolution of the problematic situation may be obtained.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The literature makes the
choice of correct--that is applicable--theory appear to be complex.  I think it
is simple.  ....  Any number of data may be applicable, but what we mean by
applicable theory is theory which does bring into intellectual availability
alternatives which in fact resolve the problematic situation.  If they don’t, 
that is what we mean by erroneous theory--theory which does not permit you to
get at the right evidences or arrange them for analysis.  The arrangement is
the structure of the theory.  ....</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            <i>[Veblen never stated
the criterion of judgment, but Ayres did.] </i> In Ayres’s work you go directly
from the theory of value to the problem.  And the theory of value doesn’t tell
you how to arrange the data.  It tells you what kinds of data you have when you
get them.  It doesn’t tell you whether you should collect this particular datum
about this particular problem, as both Veblen and Ayres thought.  ....</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Veblen sets up his
distinction which, it seems to me, ought to have permitted him to identify the
theory of value, but it didn’t.  What he did was look through all these
evidences, and then when he hit particular problems, he just applied the
instrumental theory of value over and over and over again and came out with
amazingly accurate judgments.  But you don’t know how he got there.  You can’t
discover how by just reading him.  Read the <u>Fortune Magazine</u> issue on
Veblen [36(1947):133ff].  It is worth getting just for the picture of the old
boy.  He looks like he visited a haberdashery once in a while--he looks pretty
good--but of course he never did.  He would have been astounded if anyone
intimated that they thought little enough of him to think that he might.  But <u>Fortune</u>
claimed that Veblen “was the last man who knew everything.”  Now what astounds
people about Veblen is that impression.  He didn’t know everything, but as a
figure of speech I think it is well taken to characterize his amazing
scholarship.  But to put him on the terminal position of that axis is a
mistake.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            What is astounding is that
you suddenly come out with some answers, but try to find how Veblen got them. 
You don’t find it; all you get is the distinction applying instrumental value,
the first step.  Then you get a feeling of awe and reverence about such capacity. 
The fact is, it seems to me that anybody equipped with the same theory Veblen
sort of unconsciously--and therefore sometimes sloppily--applied could reach
his unique judgments.  Look at his<u> Imperial Germany</u> or his <u>Nature of
Peace</u>.  Amazing analysis, just breathtaking.  Very heady stuff, along with
being a lot of fun.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Veblen was a very funny
guy, and I suppose he is spinning in his grave now from my saying that.  He was
funny in the form of humor you call satire, mostly.  He was an expert fun maker,
but he seldom laughed.  He went to inclusive problems where the application of
the theory of probability was high enough that he could, at his stage in the
development of the social theory, make fairly confident judgments without
having to take the trouble to work through the theory, its structure.  He
discloses nothing to you of how he arranges the data for analysis, nor which
data he gathers, beyond showing that they fall into one or the other of the
categories of the Veblenian distinction.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Ayres recognized that
problem.  He asked “What is the trouble here?” --in 1917 when he was a student
at the University of Chicago and it was still under the stimulus of Dewey and
Veblen and some pretty rugged scholarship was going on there, in the pioneering
sense, in the contribution sense. <i> [Now, trouble] </i>is that Veblen doesn’t
tell you how he makes his judgments.  Why doesn’t he tell you?  What is missing
in the “how?”  Well, the criterion of judgment is missing.  He was applying a
criterion of judgment, but didn’t know what it was.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            It seems to me the same
situation exists when you leave Ayres’s work.  It always astounded me how Ayres
could make such accurate judgments about things in the form of institutional
problems as they in fact occur.  When I originally examined how that came
about, I couldn’t see how he could do that, the fault being his: he had not
revealed to me how he did it.  And upon kicking him around about that, I found
he didn’t know. He just sort of did it.  The absence of the
how-you-go-about-it-ness between the theory of value and the judgments which he
makes when looking at particular problems, as in the case of Veblen, leaves you
sort of bewildered. You have a tendency to say, “Gosh, wasn’t he a smart
critter?  Just think! how can he say these things.”  What you are saying is,
“The bloke ought to have finished the theory.”  And it is not a matter of
genius at all; it is a simple matter of understanding.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            There are two sources of
difficulty in intellectual comprehension.  One of them is inclusiveness,
requiring the comprehension of a great many variables at the same time.  But if
you look at any one variable at any one point in time, it simply follows
another variable.  Don’t let the professional scholars bluff you into thinking
that some things are just to difficult for you to understand.  ....</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>STUDENT: <i>[Why, if technology
includes ideational tools which constitute the level of comprehension, does not
that technology specify choices between the available alternatives, and thereby
specify the structure of the institutions arising from technology?]</i></p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            There are two problems
involved, and I am afraid you might be getting the two confused.  You have the
problem of comprehension itself about any problem in the social process.  Then
you have the problem of which alternatives are in fact available to be
selected.  Technology, either in your definition or in physical-tools
definition, does not specify the alternatives selected.  It specifies the
choice you would like to see made, that is, your comprehension of the correct
choice.  But it does not specify the choice selected, because that choice is a
function--given the limits set by technological determination--of recognized
interdependence and minimal dislocation.  Technological determination sets the
limits, the other two determine the specifics.  ....</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>STUDENT<i> “It seems as though
Veblen’s students must have taken the correct first step [in using value

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            They all did.  The got the
facts, and they could tell the difference between technological and ceremonial <i>[facts]</i>. 
But they couldn’t tell which of either to gather.  They had a tendency to
gather technological facts and ignore the institutional.  Of course, Veblen
knew better than that because Veblen was applying the <i>[distinction]</i> all
the way down in some fashion or other.  But his students went out and started
counting things--a very important function.  But when they came to the actual
application of the theory to the solution of problems, they didn’t know which
way to turn.  Veblen had not disclosed to them the structure of the
how-you-go-about-it beyond his distinction.  So what they did exactly reflects
the theory they tried to apply.  The neoclassicists who approached a mature
comprehension of the Veblenian distinction began to count, to categorize, to
list, to schedule.  They drew supply and demand curves as best they could from
historical prices; they showed variations of various things.  They graphed
things that are the determinants in classical theory.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            <i>[The historical school
in America and central Europe was also influenced by Veblen.] </i> They talked
about the development of particular technologies; they examined the development
of the glass industry.  This was valuable work, but not for the reason they
think.  They wrote dissertation after dissertation of excellent description,
and then came to the point of asking what the significance of this work was. 
....  They were the ones most impressed by Veblen’s acceptance of the most
prevalent corollary of the mores principle, in which he spoke of institutions
as “gradually acquired modes of unconscious habituation.”  With that corollary,
the historical school couldn’t ask what should have been, only what had been. 
Their analyses were not the product of Veblen’s contribution, but of the theory
they thought applicable, the orthodox theory with which they were equipped.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            And the Marxists, how they
loved Veblen because they completely misunderstood him--but no more than the
classicists.  I heard an extremely able Marxist say recently, “All Veblen way
saying, Marx said a century before him.”  Technology, institutions, forces,
relations; it’s a tempting interpretation, but dead wrong.  This student found
what Veblen said to be correct and to make sense.  Then Marx furnished a theory
that got him to applications--an easy imputation, since Veblen didn’t explain
how to get there.  You could think he got there just like Marx did.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The same thing happened to
Veblen’s students.  He made a little sense out of something that no one else
had made any sense out of, so his students got all excited, and said, “Let’s
take off and solve all these problems; we’ll do it before sundown.”  And they
take off down that central high road at the beginning point, the Veblenian
distinction, without examining what is back of that--the philosophical
foundations.  All they knew in most cases was Veblen’s criticism of available
foundations, while his foundations were not sufficiently developed to be
articulated.  They were developing mostly at the hands of John Dewey.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            So Veblen’s students took
off down a nice, smooth, straight road.  Then they came to a fork and didn’t
know which one to take.  They had to do something.  Some of them rode back and
forth on the straight part of the road, counting blades of grass for the rest
of their lives.  Some went a little further.  They looked around and found some
sign posts.  The neoclassical sign post said go this way; the Marxian sign post
said go another way; the historical sign post a third way.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Reminds me of the story
about three men drunk on different drugs--one on alcohol, one on marijuana, and
one on opium.  They came to a walled city and found the gate closed.  How
decide what to do for the night?  The man drunk on alcohol said, “I’ll just
kick the blankety-blank door down.  The one drunk on opium said, “Oh no.  Just
lie down and go to sleep, and tomorrow morning when they open the gate, we’ll
just walk in.” (That’s the historian)  The one drunk on marijuana looked at it
carefully and said, “Well you guys do what you want.  But me, I’m just going to
walk through that keyhole.” (That’s the Marxians)</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The point I wanted to make
was that the area of applicability, what the statistician calls the universe,
specifies the level of generality of the theory, that is to say, its continuity
and foundation.  And a theory is, of course, general to its area of
applicability.  Now, if the universe of its applicability is temporary, it is
temporary in that same degree.  But what we are getting at here is that
universe we call the social process, and it is coterminous with human society. 
Its generality is not religiously or philosophically inhuman.  It is concerned
with experience, and that is pretty general.  It is very inclusive.  It is that
with which you are concerned in everyday life.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            It seems to me that this
blockage--to suppose that the mores principle means that the criterion of
judgment between alternatives, the theory of value, is a function of habitual
modes of behavior--precludes absolutely the use of institutional theory in the
solution of institutional problems.  That is what makes Veblen so bewildering
to most students.  That is why his critics say he isn’t going anywhere.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The reason Veblen was in
that position, I think, was that he was so clearly aware of the inapplicability
of the received doctrines that he dared not state a theory.  He constantly
gives you the impression that there can’t be any such thing as theory, and men
like Commons took off from Veblen at that point and said, “If there isn’t much
theory, let’s be practical.”  Then he sort of tries to develop a theory--which
I think is about the state of social theory at the moment.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            When you go out to solve a
social problem, you come up against the same thing as Commons came up against. 
You come to the fork in the road and all these sign posts, and you don’t know
which to take, you don’t know which theory to apply.  Well, you had better find
out where the road ought to go if none of these is right, and build that road. 
Build a road that will solve the problematic situation.  That involves a
re-examination and re-extension of the Veblenian distinction.  <i>[As the story
of Procrustes demonstrates]</i>, without a theory of value, there is no way to
tell whether you should cut off people’s legs to make them fit the bed, or
adjust the bed to the people.  You have to have a criterion of judgment.  ....</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Let’s put it this way.  If
institutional problems are not to be considered in terms of institutional
theory, then in what terms are they to be considered?  It is at this point that
it becomes obvious what the relation between the mores principle and the
utility theory of value ought to be.  ....</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'><b>lecture eleven</b></p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Last time we were talking
about the relationship between the utility theory of value and the mores
principle.  At the end of the hour, I had pointed out that the relationship
which comes into view most clearly is a supposed corollary of the principle
rather than the principle itself.  We were reduced to asking the question, if
social problems--that is to say , institutional problems--are not to be considered
in terms of institutional theory, then in what terms are they to be
considered?  Or, if the most prevalent corollary of the mores principle--that
incontinent habituation determines institutions--be correct, then the mores
principle would be equivalent to denying the point in considering social theory
at all.  Behavior would be all shadow play of unconscious and non-patterned
institutions, determined by habituation in response to a continuously varying
environment without responsibility or possibility of explaining the
determination of those patterns.  I pointed out additionally that what had been
proven in the mores principle is a matter of constitution, not of
determination, of the pattern.  ....</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The word “principle” is
used to mean a great many things.  Sometimes it is used to mean an important
fact.  To include all of the accepted uses of the word, I most frequently refer
to it as the expression of a continuing factor which may be operational or
descriptive, etc.  The mores principle is not the operational kind.  It is a
figment of what constitutes institutions--their attribute of being habitual. 
And that is all it seems to me that has been proven.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            It was certainly all that
was in Sumner’s and Frazer’s works, which make it clear that the mores and
folkways are constituted by habits, but not so determined.  When the high
priest is defending the golden bough to maintain his position of prestige and
power as the guardian, his analysis of how that began--the development of the
galaxy of correlated behavior patterns that accrued to it and around it--were
matters of discretion, purposeful behavior.  Matters in the initial stages
including a big advertising effort to spread the myth regarding one particular
guy who told the community he had something in the form of water and a tree and
the golden bough that wasn’t there.  But if he could convince the community
that it was there, then he could differentiate his product by putting on a
different brand name.  Subsequent generations came to take that development as
a matter of course, as part of accepted behavior.  Many candidates were found
for the office of high priest, even though the severity of its occupancy always
resulted in a fatality in a short time.  He couldn’t sleep, you see, because
the chair was occupied by cutting someone else’s throat.  He destroyed the high
priest in mortal combat, and thereby became high priest.  But then he couldn’t
sleep because others were ambitious to occupy that position.  This was not, in
its initial stages, I submit, “incontinent habituation.”  The reason I labor
that point somewhat is that it seems  to me to be the point of takeoff in
trying to get beyond the Veblenian or Ayresian stage of theory, particularly in
reference to the theory of institutions, for which we look at the theory of
value.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Now a sub-point.  In the
literature on this point, the notion for some reason emanates out that
habituation as such is pretty weak stuff in value terms.  Many students of
Ayres get that notion, saying, “Oh, that’s just a habit.”  “People act that way
because they don’t know any better.” which is not the same as but is inclusive
of “that’s just a habit.”  As long as a habit is instrumentally successful, you
don’t need to know any better.  No problem arises, nothing occurs which
requires the choice among alternatives.  This view can easily be generalized
into the notion that institutions are themselves nonsense.  Since they are
habitual, there is no instrumental validification of institutions.  And that is
easily reenforced by a cursory reading of the evidences of institutions
uncovered by the authors I have just mentioned, especially Sumner.  ....</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            These are not evidences
that habitual behavior is invalid or is not subject to validification.  Far
from it.  What does follow is that habitual behavior does not and cannot serve
as a basis for validification.  The mores principle, as it has been most
frequently applied, comes down to the conclusion that there is no way of
judging institutional structures.  You can’t say one structure is better than
another because both of them are matters of incontinent habituation; one cannot
be more correct than the other.  You will find, I’m sorry to say, many of us
speaking as if one culture--other than our own, of course--is as good as
another, especially if they are far removed or primitive.  They’re just
different, we say.  And I suggest also that we already and long have known
better than that.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            If the utility theory of
value is viewed as fundamentally irrational, it is a matter of what pleases and
doesn’t please, it is a function of the culture which constitutes your behavior
pattern habitually; and if that culture is a matter of unconscious habituation
admitting of no positive validification, then there is no way to judge one
pattern of correlated human behavior compared to another in terms of validity. 
No need would arise; the only excuse for studying it would then come to rest on
an unconsciously determined “dance of the atoms,” as it were, if you by chance
found it interesting.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Veblen called it “idle
curiosity,” meaning something more than non-active or the absence of personal
advantage; meaning something other than that peculiar motivation characteristic
of some particular cultural pattern--inclusive of capitalism and its pecuniary
standard.  He was trying to talk about a continuing factor under the caption
“idle curiosity,” a part of human nature.  And so was Ayres, bless him,
revealing the fruition of the more basic mistake of assuming the most prevalent
corollary of the mores principle, which requires the application of the utility
theory of value, which theory was unmistakably destroyed by both those
scholars.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            I point that out not just
in an effort to criticize great scholars, but to emphasize (heaven help me for
using that word) how difficult it is to avoid being involved in the application
of a recognized theoretical error.  It is one thing to say that you recognize
the invalidity of the utility theory of value, and it is quite another thing to
not make use of it in those areas of operations in which you have used it ever
since you learned to use ideas.  It is just like walking or any other
established habit pattern, especially where it works successfully.  And the
difficulty is further heightened by being a member of a culture--which includes
all cultures of any size up to date--which itself is constituted, in so far as
it has pattern, by the application of that particular theory.  The effort is
made constantly to apply the utility theory of value consciously and
unconsciously, primarily through the theory of justice.  And it appears in the
most scholarly work as well as the daily newspapers.  It thereby constitutes
this difficulty which must be overcome, or we cannot proceed towards an
applicable theory of the social process.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>STUDENT: <i>“If we identify a theory
of value other than utility, won’t it be impossible to incorporate the utility
theory of value into the theory yet to be identified?”</i></p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            No.  ... the utility
theory of value can be stated as a theory of something (three different somethings)
which may or may not be true, like any other theory, but which can be
approached directly as any other problem in the study of any other myth to be
approached.  When Frazer went out to look at the origin and development of this
myth about the golden bough, his use of the scientific method as an
anthropologist did not disallow his recognition of the effect and character of
the theory of the golden bough.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            There is such a thing as
utility in several different senses, any one of which can identify an important
fact.  It is unquestionably true, for example, that some things give more
pleasure than other things.  It is also true that some things hurt, give pain. 
It is also true that people make judgments relative to these two things, their
probability, desirability, etc.  Imagine a young boy deciding whether or not to
jump off of a barn roof.  He has an audience, which includes people whose good
opinion he holds dear; perhaps he has something which will add display, say a
large parasol which looks something like a parachute.  There he is, poised on
the edge.  They’re looking at him; he can’t back out without some unusually
effective escape device.  The pressure is high, it becomes a matter of honor. 
He makes a nice calculation.  He could become aware of the technological
determinants, and decide he has really made a mistake.  But still it might
work.  What happens, as I can well tell you, is he jumps off and breaks his
neck and usually lives through it.  He makes a calculation of pleasure and
pain.  Now, there is no heroism involved at all.  It’s connected with accurate
judgments of fact, which have nothing to do with outside functions.  We make
calculations </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>like that all the time.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            There is no denying the
very great importance of the hedonistic calculus, a thing which I and others
attack constantly.  But I will have you note that it cannot be attacked
successfully as if it doesn’t exist.  It does exist.  It can be attacked only
as a theory of human motivation.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The theory, then, if it
were approached scientifically, that is to say, rationally, involves the
determination of how things come to be desirable or undesirable. And if you do
it that way, then the question of motivation is beside the point, simply a
matter of taxonomy without further recourse as such, a matter the explanation
of which is causally exterior to it.  Because then you have merely set up some
captions and said by definition that whatever falls under this one is positive
motivation and whatever falls under that one is negative.  Then you still have
the whole problem you had originally of explaining human behavior--choices
among alternatives.  Whether it is pleasure and pain or otherwise, you still
have the theory of value to explain.  ....</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Now note, that if the
utility theory is viewed as fundamentally irrational, then indeed all patterns
of human relationships are relative to the total cultural pattern of which they
are a part.  Then, indeed, there is no way to cross between cultures, and then
there is no way to cross over between alternative behavior patterns in a
particular culture.  It all depends on which one is successfully established,
which is a matter of advertising, not a matter of scientific understanding; if
you can get it adopted,you’ve got it made.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Then the question arises,
are there no more continuing factors than that in the question of choosing
among alternatives?  Are there in fact continuous factors relating to the
matter of the criterion itself?  If this hedonistic business holds, then the
corollary one of the mores principles does in fact hold.  And if it does in
fact hold, then it doesn’t make any difference.  Science becomes nonsense in
its application to that problem. Instead of science, what we should do is
advertise.  Decide what we want, and then convince people.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Now, where it comes to
equally convincing situations without understanding of either, then it
“ultimately” results in fascism--conviction through force.  Advertising, when
it abandons explanation I suggest, is in fact an application of that
principle.  An explanation becomes useless.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>             But there is a difference
between the continuity of the forces of explanation, between rational choice
based on evidences, and establishing patterns of correlated behavior through
coercive direction of those patterns.  ....</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'><b>lecture twelve</b></p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            We have been talking about
the relationship between value theory and social analysis, and I have tried to
get at it so far through an examination of how utility theory has been and is
involved in social analysis and social behavior.  We have got at that through
several different items, most of which have involved the mores principle and
how the utility theory is related to some corollaries which are attributed to
the mores principle.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>STUDENT:<i> “Veblen in <u>The Place of
Science</u> makes the statement than man’s nature is teleological ...  It seems
to me that, if he really believed that statement, it is sort of predestination
toward a preconceived end.  And certainly that is not in conformity with the
Veblenian distinction.”</i></p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Yes, but not necessarily. 
To say that man is driven in some sense toward behavior patterns in conformity
with his nature may be teleological and it may not be.  The teleology would
require the preconception aspect of it, and that requires something outside of
man.  It requires the “guiding hand.”  To grant human nature doesn’t mean that
you grant a predetermined end in the sense that you grant a particular pattern
of behavior as an end toward which the patterns of behavior are trending.  The
fact is, it seems to me, quite the contrary.  If that were true, then the
theory of value would specify the end.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The whole effort here is
to identify the theory of value which, it seems, turns out to be such in fact
as not to drive toward a particular end in the sense of a particular pattern of
behavior, or even a very generally identified pattern of behavior within which
there may be variations.  We are thereby required to look at human nature to
see if it does in fact correlate, dictate, in the sense of result in, a drive
toward a particular pattern of behavior.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>STUDENT: <i>“Maybe my interpretation
of the word “teleology” is wrong, because I thought it connoted some innate
characteristic, internal characteristic, that coerced arrival at some
preconceived end.”</i></p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            It does that, but that is
also true of any concept of human nature.  The teleological concept requires
that that end be a specific condition, thus not by virtue of having innate
characteristics.  You see, it is inevitably and necessarily true that anything
separately identifiable has factors continuous with that thing, including human
beings.  Otherwise, you could not separately identify human beings.  And if
those factors are continuous, they continue to have their effect.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Now the whole point of the
effort in this course is to see that it is not a particular pattern of behavior
at any level of generalization.  And when I say behavior, I mean social
behavior.  I don’t mean the beating of your heart, which is a behavior pattern
toward which, if you will, your very structure ... correlates at your
commencement and your cessation.  We act that way.  That’s the way we are. 
That is our nature, and it is continuous with the universe of application, that
is to say, with human beings.  That is a particular behavior pattern, but it
isn’t social behavior.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            What we are here concerned
with is institutions: correlated human behavior, relations between people.  And
that is a very different thing.  Though there are continuous factors in social
behavior, they are not such as to specify a given behavior pattern, nor are
they such as to require that kind of end.  ....</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The teleology of it is not
the acceptance of nature, as it were.  It is not the acceptance of continuing
factors, but the character of those factors.  As Veblen explains in his attack
on the received doctrine, the teleology, though in fact denied, is clearly
there by virtue of the direction toward a particular pattern of behavior on the
occasion of the removal of obstructions which deviated it from that direction. 
Veblen’s proof of the teleology, even though everyone since 1776 denied the
teleological aspect of what Veblen says, is still a part of their theory.  And
I think Veblen is right about it--going this way, toward that order which
establishes itself as if of its own accord.  The natural order, in this case
that particular pattern of institutions we usually speak of as laissez faire
capitalism.  Then somebody does something, like impose a tariff or duty or
restrictions or specifications in relation to price, or service, or character
of the product, and it goes off in another direction, that is to say, welfare
capitalism or something.  Then it is going this way, and at this point you
remove whatever it is that made it go down.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Now in nature, Veblen
says, things go on until something changes.  Well, the demonstration of the
theory is not only if you take it away, it doesn’t keep going, it goes back up
and continues on its way.  Something turns it back, something that is outside
the process.  That, says Veblen, requires an assumption which is teleological
in character.  There is an end toward which the continuing factors, both inside
and outside of human nature, push the pattern of correlated human behavior. 
And it is that which constitutes the teleology, not the fact of continuing
factors but that kind of continuing factors.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Now note that Veblen says
that requires a consciousness of that end.  Carl Becker tries to make this
point--and I argue with him too, as you know--that though the spokesmen of the
Age of Reason, including Adam Smith, John Locke and even Francis Bacon,
destroyed the “Heavenly City” of St. Augustine by denying God’s will, they
rebuilt the city with<i> [natural] </i>materials, the classical theory.  It
isn’t really nature  that they are talking about, it is still God; someone who
decides and pushes it.  Nature doesn’t change its mind, but there is mind
involved here, say Veblen and Becker.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Where I argue with them is
on the other point, that is, how man is involved in this.  There is no possible
conception of the utility theory of value in application to the problem which
does not always involve an end in view.  That is why the “isms.”  That is what
an “ism” is: a demonstration of how you get to that end.  Now that may take any
form.  And Veblen was trying to get at a demonstration ... of how discretion is
involved here and how the theory of logic is involved.  He doesn’t attack the
problem, but he did see that no matter what you have in view requires a
teleological assumption of direction by the “guiding hand.”  There is something
which guides the hand.  It isn’t altogether clear in Hume.  It would be a
little difficult to make the case against Hume on that score because he took
the classical anarchist’s position in a fashion which sort of disallows the
whole works.  He argues with them too, like Veblen does, on the same score, but
he comes out in the same place. But he denies it all the time, so when you get
there, you just say, well, I just got here, it was no part of my own
intention.  Sort of like the drunk who ends up in jail.  And he is sort of
offended.  He intended no wrong!  Yes he did; he obstructs the sufficient
participation of which he is capable.  ....</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The relationship we are
seeking is the functions of problem solving which arise out of the human
capacity to make choices, which necessarily involves the application of some
theory of value.  And that involves the demonstration of the capacity to make
choices evidentially--not only the capacity,but the exercise of it, in fact, as
a continuing factor in human behavior.  That is what I was trying to get at
last time when I was sort of kicking Ayres and Veblen around in terms of their
blockage in respect to determination of habitual behavior.  ....</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Habitual behavior may be
good or bad.  The only thing we know about its being habitual is that it has
been done a great many times.  It has been repeated sufficiently often to
become accepted without critical view, without the exercise of reason.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Now, we have gotten at
value theory through several different ways: the mores principle, the theory of
justice, the prominent position of utility theory, the distinction between
application and efforts at application.  All have this in common: they already
involve a realization of the value problem as continuously and necessarily
consonant with every item at every point or part of the social process.  The
problem is the relationship between social analysis and value theory.  The
relationship is this: </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The successful
continuation of human relations in correlation with each other, </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            that is to say, the
continuation of the social process, necessarily involves solving</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            problems, resolving
situations which infringe upon the continuity of that process.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            We are not concerned with
non-human, after-human, or before-human processes.  We are concerned with
social analysis which, to be significant, must necessarily be applicable to the
resolution of those situations which do observably or comprehensibly infringe
upon the continuation of that process.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Everyone agrees with what
I just said in terms of their behavior, and most people agree verbally.  Some,
for amusement or otherwise, just say no, that death is a good thing and life is
a bad thing.  Then they go right on living, when it is very easy not to.  They
talk one way and act another, and I think that is dishonest.  They say life
doesn’t mean anything, and then act as if it did.  .... <i> [If such a person]</i>
is alive very long he is acting as if life were preferable to death, and for
that reason he could not make a rational choice of suicide.  That choice isn’t
genuine: you choose not to have choices.  There are no social choices beyond
life.  Choice means alternatives, and alternatives don’t exist in death. 
Alternatives exist in life, and social alternatives exist in social life, and
social life ceases at death.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            And alternatives means the
presence of problems.  The problem is how you go about knowing which
alternative to take.  The answer is value theory.  The significance of value in
social theory is that it constitutes validification, comprehension of how to go
about knowing correct choices.  It constitutes how you go about finding out
what is right and what is wrong socially, without which you can make no
effective choices in social behavior.  Deny it as you will, it is still true
that wherever a problem exists--and that is a constant condition--that exercise
necessarily goes forward.  It goes forward as an observable fact.  If it goes
forward continuously, and the effort is to apply an erroneous theory, is not
that effort also continuous with human experience?</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Some students, I think,
get the feeling that I am being inconsistent whey I say--as I always do--that
ever since we have had any knowledge of human behavior, they have been trying
to apply the utility theory of value, and at the same time I identify
continuity with truth, </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>and thus with validity.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Continuity as we use it
here does not mean lasting a long time.  It means uninterrupted and necessary
involvement in the continuum of which the question is asked.  Then about human
behavior, might we not say that efforts to apply the utility theory of value
are continuous with human history, and that what I propose as the criterion of
judgment seems not to have been spoken of very much until recently, and then
only by a few--isn’t that pretty temporary?</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Of course that is pretty
temporary, but let us get our two problems straight.  One, the actual operation
of a theory of value in human experience, the actual criterion of judgment in
social experience.  And two, those theories we say we are applying and those
which we said we did apply.  There is often a great difference between the way
we behave and the way we talk, and especially is that true of the theory of
value.  And I think I am prepared to demonstrate that what we have done in its
actual application has been completely contrary to, in the sense of not
included in but rather exclusive of, the utility theory.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Of course, we use the
hedonistic calculus in making judgments where it is applicable.  And you can
define the hedonistic calculus components in such a manner as to simply state
the problem and forbid its examination.  You can make it a sort of truism.  But
if you try to explain how we in fact behave in making judgments, and how that
behavior impinges upon the social process in the form of resolving those
situations which impinge upon it frictionally, the solely significant
operating, effective criterion of judgment is quite something else.  Of course
you know we call it several things.  I prefer to call it the “instrumental
theory of value.  Ayres calls it the “technological theory of value,” which is
a sloppy way to put it, it seems to me.  It ought to be clear that not only is
the theory of value continually involved in social analysis, but also that the
theory of value which is in fact applied, is what is necessary to understanding
as well as to understanding significance and effects of efforts to apply
theories of value which in fact cannot be applied.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'><b>lecture thirteen</b></p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>STUDENT: <i>“Is the animistic concept
necessarily a part of the teleology conception?”</i></p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Yes.  Without <i>[animism]</i>
there could be no teleology in the sense that Veblen tried to <i>[identify it
in]</i> the classical theory.  ....</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Last time we were talking
about the involvement of value theory in social analysis, and we bound it up
with problem solving, suggesting that value theory is used wherever the
function is carried on which involves it.  To say that value isn’t involved in
problem solving but is only sort of an academic exercise would put us in the
position of saying that a process is going on but the determinants of that
process are not there.  To repeat: to take the position that the process of
selecting among alternatives--a process which everyone admits necessarily goes
on constantly-- and at the same time to take the position that value theory
need not enter in as a determinant of human behavior.  You put yourself in the
position of an impossible paradox of trying to explain a process while denying
the possibility or need to identify its determinants.  Even restricting
analysis to description, you would thereby be taking the position that you can
describe something, part of the components of which you will not recognize or
tolerate.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The reason is that, if
there is not in fact the relationship which we set up last time--the relationship
between human predilections, preferences, tastes and the social process--then
science has no place in human affairs.  Rational analysis has no basis for
consideration, and truth and falsehood become inseparable and
indistinguishable, depending upon your predilections about predilections.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            You can recognize
predilections without taking the position that predilections are determined by
your predilections about predilections.  ....  It is sort of the same thing as
talking about non-evidentially determined areas of explanation.  You are
carrying on a double play which is necessary in the social sciences.  If you
recognize the place of reason in human behavior, you examine the determination
of human decisions by making decisions about decisions.  You make judgments
about judgments, and some of those judgments about which you are making
judgments are non-evidentially determined.  This situation generates a tendency
or feeling that you can’t have a rational explanation of value.  You can’t have
a non-magical explanation of magic.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            If that be true, of
course, then it is necessarily the case that science in the analysis of human
behavior is largely irrelevant, because a large part of human behavior is
irrational, in the sense that the conceptual operations of which the actual
behavior other than those operations are physical presentations, are themselves
irrational.  The concepts can be irrational, and so the things which eventuate
from them in the form of other behavior than the concept would be irrational. 
The imputation follows that you can’t examine irrational behavior rationally.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Of course you can.  How do
you think the magician makes his living?  Exactly that way.  He pulls a rabbit
out of the hat, and you know rabbits don’t come out of hats.  And the magician,
knowing that the community knows that, makes it seem like rabbits come out of
hats, and we think that’s sort of funny.  It is wonderful entertainment because
it is a series of incongruities which you know beforehand have been carefully
plotted.  So you know he is fooling you, and the game is to find out how he is
doing it.  He says he isn’t kidding you, knowing all the time that you know
that he is kidding you, and that makes it funny.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            But it isn’t fully when
you think he is really not kidding you, when men kill each other because they
think that way.  In a sense, all human mistakes are of that character: war, or
two men fighting.  There is nothing sillier than two men fighting.  There is an
old saying that two grown men can’t fight, unless one or both of them is nuts
or something.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            There is no way to escape
the plain practical fact that value theory plays a part in the ongoing of the
social process.  The part that it plays is that it serves as a criterion of
judgment  in choosing among alternatives, which operation occurs and can only
occur in the resolution of problematic situations.  That is a constant in human
experience, not only individually, but to the community at large.  It is not a
question of theory but of fact.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Then the question arises,
if that be true, what is this fact?  What is that which serves in fact as the
criterion of judgment in choosing between good and bad socially?  Because it is
immediately apparent that whatever that criterion is will determine the
character of the choices made.  You take any example of two persons trying to
use different criteria in reference to the same set of facts.  They get
different answers.  They can get the same answer to different sets of facts in
trying to apply different criteria, but they can’t get the same answer to the
same set of facts applying different criteria.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Earlier, I used the
example of two persons considering the matter of slum clearance, both closely
acquainted with the facts, equipped with the knowledge in relation to the same
items.  The one using the utility theory of value with the only available
theory of valuation--the price theory of valuation--comes out with the major
corollary of the mores principle that there isn’t anything you can do about it
because you can’t make a judgment until after the action the propriety of which
is in question.  The whole difficulty with that theory is that it makes
planning impossible.  If there is no way to make a judgment about an action
except after observing that action, then anarchy is the only tenable position. 
That is to say, it makes laissez faire the answer to all problems.  That is to
say, it denies the genuineness of the problem.  Thus, you can’t have problems,
“really.”  But if you can’t have problems “really,”--and this begins to sound
very much like nonsense--the answer to the problems would be not to consider
the problems.  And that, I suggest, is nonsense.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            To consider what to do
about something about which you know that you can do nothing is nonsense, isn’t
it?  No one ever really took that position, I guess.  But they try to take it. 
And since no one has ever taken it, we might ask ourselves, why not?  Is not
the theory there, the whole apparatus?  Is not the concept well pronounced? 
Are not the more restricted areas of application of the general theory
available in specific presentation for application to a particular problem?  Of
course it is.  It is the whole content of modern economics in the orthodox
development.  Then, if it is there, why don't they take a consistent position
on that score?  It is the non-applicability of erroneous theory.  As Malthus
pointed out in regard to Ricardo’s work in 1821, it “ill becomes” economists to
set up a theory to explain human behavior, and then be required by the run of
the facts to explain most human behavior as exceptions to that explanation.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            When you get more
exceptions than you get conformities, then you ought to change the rules. 
Especially if you get more exceptions all of which have genericy sufficiently
identifiable to permit the establishment of another rule or, as Malthus would
say, a law.  Well, I suggest that that is the situation now in relation to
utility theory.  It doesn’t make the run of the facts.  You have to have
exceptions, and open some other door than the front door--value theory--or you 
just can’t get out of there.  You couldn’t make a choice in terms of estimation
of preferences, meaning in terms of estimation of comparative propriety.  You
couldn’t do anything.  You are in fact close to the nihilist.  And I suggest
that that is the source of the recent flurry of nihilism, which has been
responded to with all sorts of positivisms all over the world, the most highly
advertised one being the recent western European rise of Communism.  ....</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Yes to your first
question, no to your second.  Myth inhibits problem solving.  The fact that
potassium cyanide is coated with sugar doesn’t keep it from killing.  And the
fact that you die with a smile on your face, as if you love it, doesn’t keep
you from being dead.  Acceptability does not keep it from being an error.  I
suspect that most of humanity which has been destroyed by humanity is in that
category.  It doesn’t solve any problems, and that is what is so horrible about
sugar-coating things where you aren’t concerned with the coating but with the
things.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>STUDENT: <i>“Doesn’t that make it
easier for those in control to maintain their control--help them to solve their
problem?”</i></p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Yes.  But it is their
personal problem.  The social problem is not how to maintain their control; it
is mostly how not to maintain their control.  The social problem usually is how
to get the sugar off of the darned thing.  If you get the thing sugared enough,
you can maintain control as long as the coating is there.  But you can’t get
away from the effects of the thing that’s coated.  You can make people believe
that it’s good to smoke marijuana, but you can’t get away from the fact that
smoking marijuana makes them sick.  The technological determination of the
problem is still there.  Even though you think that the highest state of human
accomplishment is to be drunk on marijuana; even though you think that the
highest attainment of man is illth; even though you punch needles through your
arms to prove it, and grin like an opossum to show the aesthetic attainment of
which you are capable (what you are really showing is a skill at
auto-hypnosis), it still doesn’t take away the effects of the operation.  The
effects are there irrespective of what you caption it or like or don’t like.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>STUDENT: <i>“Several times you have
criticized the idea of a conflict between institutional and individual
interests, and you claim that there is actually an equality of interests, that
they aren’t in conflict.  Explain that equality.”</i></p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Suffice to say at the
moment that it is clear with the slightest observation that the economy is a
collaborative activity.  Collaborative in that it is carried on through
correlation of human efforts, and that it is impossible in the technological
sense that the interests of one person be different than the interests of
another person in that sense.  The only way you can get a difference in their
interests is in some other sense, namely invidious.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Now the same thing is true
in relations between the individual and the community economically.  Quite
clearly, the individual’s interests economically  are identical with the
community’s interest.  If the individual’s interest be conceived as
instrumentally effective participation in the social process--and I think it
can be conceived correctly in no other way--then it necessarily follows that
the individual’s interests and the community’s interests are the same.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Ceremonially, yes--the
individual’s interests are always divergent from the community’s interests. 
And if invidious differences are born to man, then it is true that the
individual’s and community’s interests diverge.  But if that not be true, the
contrary is the case: it is “better” for all individuals to participate as
effectively (instrumentally) as they can.  And that is <u>exactly</u> the
interest of the community.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Returning to the effects
of an idea, a predilection non-evidentially determined, determined on the basis
of the attainment or maintenance of power, never solved any genuine social
problem.  It creates social problems.  If you say the problem is solved, you are
really saying that you have power.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Take the problem of slum
clearance.  We tried philanthropy when we first went at it, and the slums
continued to grow.  We tried limited dividend corporations--one of the most
beautiful slum clearance projects of America was built that way in New York
City--and the slums continued to grow, with all of the incidences of slum
existence still there.  We tried Jehovah’s Witnesses; we tried education; we
tried everything we could think of, and they still continued to grow.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            When the fight arose in
New Orleans, one of the worst slum cities in the world for about four
generations, an argument something like this ensued:  First, “Why, gosh.  These
people love the slums.  People come from all over the world to wallow in them
and get as sinful as they can, so it must be fun.”  The idea is very common
that if it is sinful enough it must be fun--a silly but prevalent notion.  You
find it applied to the law: if it’s illegal, it sort of must be fun.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            First, slum dwellers like
it.  Second, the proof of it is that they are willing to pay for it, and if you
took them out of their slum, you would do an injustice to them--destroying
their homes in which they have bound up their lives; the old rickety house with
germs five generations back, rats running all over.  They love them; they would
be uncomfortable in standard houses.  And that’s all true.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Another kind of argument:
society can’t afford it.  Where is the money coming from?  Another kind: if you
plan, you are assuming some other theory of value than the utility theory of
value, and if you are, you are a dictator.  That’s what is meant by the often
repeated dictum that if you scratch the skin of a planner, you will find a
dictator.  And they are correct, in the sense that planning anything is
contrary to the utility theory of judgment.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            A plan is explicit
recognition of a problem in relation to which you have some way of judging
alternatives.  Your plan is a configuration of judgments of alternatives, which
means that you can anticipate something before you act.  That is to say, there
is applicable theory in human affairs.  That is to say that the answer that
utility theory drives you to is untrue--that you can’t observe until after the
act, so you can’t plan.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            It is pretty easy to see
that the utility theory of value does not serve the function it purports to
serve: It doesn’t solve problems.  It doesn’t permit the admissibility of a
problem.  It does not even permit recognition of a choice prior to the act.  It
does not ever permit human culture.  All it permits is the corollary from the
mores principle: whatever is, is.  Which though true, is not helpful.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Then our problem becomes
immediately apparent.  That is, what is in fact used in the resolution of a
problem?  What is the theory of value--the criterion of judgment--used in
choosing among alternatives.  We shall get at it by looking at the actual
operation of making choices among alternatives, and looking directly at what we
are doing.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            I want to look at this
problem of the seeming involvement of predeterminism in any theory of value
other than an animistic one.  The difficulty is conceiving genuineness of
choices and, at the same time, granting continuity--in the sense I have defined
previously.  In its plainest form, it frequently appears thus: If it be true
that things are causally determined, then are not the choices made equally
determined by those causes?  If the choices are what they are by virtue of the
causally antecedent determinants, then how can you get genuine choice?</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The argument has run in
philosophy for at least 3000 years: you may think you made a genuine, free
choice, but the causal antecedents of that choice were whatever they were
before the choice was made, and they specified the choice, which seems to
destroy the concept of genuineness.  And if there be no genuine choice, then
the whole analysis of value is beside the point.  If there isn’t such a thing
as reason, which itself is explicable in terms of causal determination, then
you are reduced to the nihilist position.  There is either a blind “dance of
the atoms,” or patterns which are internally consistent in causal terms, which
means predetermination.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            But if the causal
determination is not exclusive of genuine choice, then predetermination doesn’t
follow, and it makes sense to look at the matter of value.  The prevailing
supposition--often elaborately camouflaged--is that, if you have causal
determination, you have predetermination.  If the causal determination includes
the theory of value, you have predetermination.  If the causal determination
excludes the theory of value, you have two choices, two possibilities: one, an
animistic direction in which you don’t have a dance of the atoms or, two, a
non-animistic direction, in which case you do have a dance of the atoms.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Now beginning with our
everyday experience, we know that an airplane engine isn’t just a dance of the
atoms.  We know that rabbits don’t come out of hats.  We know that there is
pattern in that sense.  There is science, patterns drawn in causal terms.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>STUDENT: <i>“Can’t you have
determinism in the universe as a whole, while having a large number of
alternatives and, therefore, have genuine choice?  Marx said history leads
inexorably to the downfall of capitalism, but he recognized alternatives even in
that deterministic proposition.”</i></p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            That’s the kind of
confusion I was talking about when I said that no matter how you camouflage it,
it is still there.  You can say that the problem arises out of something else
and, therefore, the problem is exterior to the universe.  You can say that,
being such, it is subject to identification exterior to the operation of the
whole.  But you can’t have determinism and include in the universe the process
of making judgments, and at the same time take the position that you don’t have
determinism in the process.  You can’t say that you recognize determinism in
the universe as a whole, and then say that by increasing the number of
alternatives you can increase genuine choices in one aspect of that universe.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            You and Marx and Ricardo
are all involved in the same confusion.  It is determinist everywhere except in
those who determine it, and they have free choice.  Marx said two things at the
same time.  One: the five laws of capitalist development--the positive
tendencies, continuous, uninterrupted, interminable in the universe of
capitalism resulting inevitably in a contradiction.  Two: human nature
resulting in class conflict.  Out of the chaos the proletariat will win, given
the continuing factors of human nature--self interest, and a single class for
whom self interest means no other classes, will lead to classless society.  No
other class could exist, says Marx, without the proletariat, without labor in
his terminology.  So you will have a class society so long as there is any
class in power determining the relations of production other than labor.  But
when labor comes to power, as it does in the laws of the development of
capitalism, all classes will be destroyed other than labor.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            That is not accidental; it
is not because someone says so.  The theory of communism is why someone says
so.  Marx said this will come about because of the forces at play and because
of the nature of human beings.  His whole thesis is saying, “Rise up, workers,
and shed your chains,” etc., because this won’t come about if you don’t do
something about it.  At the same time, he is saying he has the explanation of
how you cannot avoid coming to that decision.  To Marx’s mind, he was saying
you do it because you have to.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>STUDENT:<i> “A professor in this
school characterized Ayres as Ayres-ism.  He considers an “ism” to be generic
with mores, because it specifies right or wrong.  I’m sort of confused.  Your
definition of an “ism” is, as I understand, a particular institutional
structure, a particular pattern of institutions.”</i></p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The gentleman is mistaken,
if he wasn’t being facetious.  Ayres provides you with a way of judging an
institution in terms of whether it is good or bad; he doesn’t tell you which
institutions are good or bad.  There is no institution which as such is good or
bad.  An “ism” is exactly the contrary in its eventuation.  What I speak of as
an “ism,” of course, is a system of theoretical structure which validates a
particular institutional structure.  The “ism” isn’t the structure, but it
validates one.  What structure does Ayres validate?  That is to ask, what
“ism?”  None.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The gentleman doesn’t
understand Ayres at that point.  And that is what I tried to bring out in the
discussion of the relationship between the mores principle and the utility
theory of value.  The utility theory of value necessarily, it seems to me,
results in an ismatic approach to social problems, because you like the things
you learn to like.  And what you learn to like is a function of the cultural
pattern within which habits are determined.  Thus, any application of the
utility theory of value gives you a theoretical structure for analyzing
problems but cannot solve problems.  It justifies existing institutions, as a
corollary of the mores principle.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Ayres’s work denies the
validity of any institution as such.  Validity in Ayres’s analysis does not lie
in institutions.  As he says over and over, the locus of value is not in
institutions.  The sum result of Ayres’s work in “ism” terms is the denial of
“isms.”</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>STUDENT:<i> “The common sense reaction
to Ayres’s approach takes the form of believing that, in some sense or other,
there must be an “ism” to it, because to deviate from an actual relativism
position means that you assume some doctrinaire position, and you get that
dualism you described.”</i></p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Yes.  The same thing the
critics found with Veblen.  He isn’t going anywhere--where meaning an “ism,” a
particular pattern of institutional arrangements.  And that’s right.  Neither
Ayres nor Veblen is going any that kind of “where.”  On the other hand, that
would seem to the student at that stage of the analysis to be key to
understanding either.  If you preclude the possibility of a natural-order
basis, then something else is guiding the process as it goes we-
know-not-where.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            That kind of positivism is
making strong replacement just as of now.  We don’t know “where;” agreement
there.  But we know there is a “where,” and positivists think we will know when
we get there, to some outside-the-process situation, unknown and unknowable,
normative but “there.”  And of course they require an animistic teleology by
virtue of habit or something--a particular pattern of human nature or God as
the fundamental datum in understanding the social process.  Another emanation
of the mores principle.  ....</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Last time we were trying
to get close enough to the value problem to see what we are up against.  An
item we ought to examine here is the effort in the immediately current
literature--clearly discernible only in the last four or five years, since the
war--to retain validification in terms of an unarticulated but nevertheless
fairly definite pattern of institutions and, at the same time, to seem to have
abandoned that basis.  It is parallel to the heavenly city of the 18th century
philosophers, who made the same effort to make sense out of what they knew,
abandoning teleology but retaining the full stock of working conceptuology with
which they had developed value theory.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            It has taken the form of
the requirement to recognize that we don’t know, and cannot know, anything
about where we are ultimately going, in terms of institutional structure.  It
is no longer Veblen’s pre-Darwinian scholarship, but it is an effort to hold
the same results after explicitly recognizing the necessity of abandoning the
way those results were expressed in the literature.  It is being done as, “We
don’t know where we’re going, but we’re on our way,” still retaining the belief
that there is a “where” to where we are going in terms of institutional
structure.  So the analysis now, in the last rampart of getting to a particular
structure, is to deny knowledge of the structure and to deny the possibility of
using it in the analysis of our experiences, yet managing to retain the same
results of the old analysis: to wit, the validification of a particular
institutional pattern.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            This has been done at the
philosophical level through the normative-positive distinction, and at the
social science level, so to speak, through the intellectual permission
furnished by that distinction to be concerned entirely with the operation of
particular patterns of institutions without question of efficacy at any stage. 
The result is a simple catalog description, which itself cannot be accomplished
without valuation.  When valuation is inescapably and consciously encountered,
the escape device is to the effect that it can be judged only relative to the
culture which accredits it--any pattern of human behavior--and then proceeding
as if no imputation of value had been made.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Thus, you see, the social
analyst can reach exactly the same conclusions through what I have
characterized as an imputation upon encountering the value problem, by virtue
of the denial of the knowledge of ultimates which comes out of the normative-positive
distinction in philosophy, the normative being unknown and unknowable in the
sense that you can know positive data.  So, I think, you will find the
literature at that stage in most part: the amelioration of the naked problem as
it appeared theretofore up until the recent repudiation of  the utility
theory.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Before that, the problem
could be met head on and answered directly, and still attain the validification
of a particular pattern of institutions.  After the failure of the intellectual
permission offered by the utility theory of value, recourse has been taken to
what I have just stated in order to maintain validification of a particular
pattern of human relations.  That literature I expect to expand feverishly,
particularly in philosophy and economics, before it dies altogether.  There is
an almost vehement fear of any effort at the organized representation of
institutions in professional scholarship in the social sciences now, a fear of
any effort to go beyond the normative-positive distinction or to question it,
the reason of course being implicit in what we have already examined.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            If you abandon recourse to
the normative-positive distinction, you abandon “isms,” and you abandon any
hope of validating any particular “ism” as such.  That is why people become
proponents and opponents of utility theory:  Which pattern of institutions does
this theory validate?  The answer has proponents and opponents.  When that
possibility is gone, that is to say, when you abandon the normative-positive
distinction supporting utility theory, then social theory can no longer perform
that function of inconclusive debate.  Then it becomes a science.  ....</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            At any particular stage in
the development of social theory, you will find feverish effort to maintain the
answers which can no longer be maintained in the old form. A revamping of the
theory, always the same answers.  No one any longer asks such questions of
areas of inquiry--such as physics--where theories are constructed in view of
the scientific criterion. But I would have you note that time was, not so long
ago, when that was the most explosive question on this earth.  When it became
apparent that physics could no longer be used to validate one particular power
structure or another, physicists were burned at the stake, they suffered
physical torture because the earth revolves around the sun.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Even at the time of the
publication of <u>The Origin of Species</u> and <u>Ancient Law</u>, Maine’s
study caused hardly a ripple compared to Darwin’s. <i> [Today] </i>no sane
biologist would question the validity of the question that Darwin was asking. 
They now disagree with Darwin mostly in the details because of subsequent
analysis, but accept the validity of the question of whether and how species
come to be.  No one would have the slightest hesitation--even at Baylor
University where it is explicitly forbidden by administrative fiat--to
recognize the validity of that question.  Since Hermann Joseph Muller’s work,
there is no ground for denying the validity of that question.  But it occurs. 
Within my lifetime we have had trials and sent men to prison.  Sir Henry Maine
asked exactly the same question about the law, and no one raised an eyebrow. 
But today, Maine’s<u> Ancient Law</u> is causing a revolution.  In law schools
today, students found in possession of that book are looked at askance by many
professors.  A hundred years since its publication.  Why?  The problem hadn’t
arisen then.  Then you could still validate a legal structure through the
utility theory of value and its applications, for the most part the theory of
justice coming in through the mores principle. </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            A century ago, biological
theory was new and was still used to validate institutional structure, to
validate patterns of human relationships--racial discrimination, citizenship, property
rights.  Today, biology has nothing to do with those things, but then, biology
was an area of vehement turmoil.  And if Darwin’s question were a genuine one,
it knocked the whole business into a cocked hat.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            What happened in biology
and physics, and even earlier in astronomy, was the attainment of rational
value theory that cut out the possibility of validification of a power
structure through that area.  That is the point at which the struggle gets
bitter.  In that respect, law is today where biology was 100 years ago.  And
since Veblen, political economy is in that stage, where the best scholars in
the field suspect that it is no longer serviceable as validification of a
particular institutional structure.  That is to say, it has become a science. 
Not that it has solved all its problems, or even begun to find the questions
that it should ask itself.  But it has attained the possibility of scientific
analysis, and that possibility stage causes the turmoil.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            We have already seen that,
in the actual resolution of a problematic situation, you can’t use the utility
theory of value.  You can use it in your formulation and explanation, but you
can’t use it in your operations, because it isn’t true.  That is to say, it
isn’t in conjugate correspondence with the facts of the case--the criterion of
judgment permitting resolution of problematic situations.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            What I hoped to make clear
last time was that we are asking what criterion of judgment to use.  We can’t
conceive a problem without an application of the theory of value.  We can’t
solve a problem without the application of a theory of value, in the sense that
the recognition of a problem means that something is wrong, missing,
incomplete.  Those are judgments--something is out of order, something isn’t working. 
We are making what Lionel Robbins would call normative judgments, that is to
say, value judgments  There is no practical operation other than habitual or
random which does not require the knowing and using of that which is supposedly
unknown and unusable.  So we might as well divest ourselves of that
nonsense--to try to operate using something which is unknown and unknowable.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            If we know anything at
all, we know that we do make normative judgments.  So we can set up a
normative-positive distinction in human experience on other grounds.  Those
words “normative-positive distinction” can have an instrumental value.  But in
the sense in which it is now being used in the literature, there is no such
distinction and can be no such distinction.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            So we are confronted with
recognizing the absolute necessity of the use of a theory of value.  ....</p>

with the efficient ongoing of the economic process by trying to apply the
utility criterion of judgment to the solution of these problems which are of a
different character.  You can’t apply the instrumental criterion at the same
time that you apply a non-instrumental criterion.  And if the problem is what
it is by virtue of efforts to apply a non-instrumental criterion of any sort,
you hit the missing middle.  You don’t partly apply one and partly apply the
other to the same problem.  What you are doing is trying to apply one to one
problem and the other to another problem.  Solutions like invidious
differentiations, which may appear to an individual or a group or a community
as having solved the problem, do not remove the incidences of the genuine
problem.  The solution to artificial problems is to stop trying to apply the
wrong theory of value.  They are problems of human folly which, when solved in
invidious terms, not only do not solve the problem but create additional
genuine problems.</p>

that they are humanly conceptual and come out of intellectual intercourse with
other humans.  But they are not simply what we have learned, as is the case

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            What I hoped to get into
is the matter of the character of the social problem within a particular
institution or a few institutions, as part of the whole of the institutional
scheme.  The tendency in that regard is to confuse a problem arising within a
particular institutional structure with a particular item in that structure. 
The tendency is to try to look at that kind of social problem in the same sense
that you look at a personal problem as distinct from a social problem, that is
to say, as a matter of what constitutes the kind of given data, rather than
which is the correct distinction between the personal and the social problem.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            It seems to me the social
problem arising within a particular institution within the whole cultural
scheme of institutions is quite another kind, despite its similarity with any
other social problem.  And the distinction involves a preview, or at least some
light on, what I shall call the principle of recognized interdependence and the
principle of minimal dislocation.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            A point I want to bring up
before we proceed, however, is this matter of equilibrium and, of course, the
parallel question of the equational theory of justice, which is one of the
applications of the theory.  Far and away the clearest and most sharply defined
instance of it is in economics, in the mathematical presentation of the
economic process by theorists like <i>[Pareto,] </i>Cassel, <i>[and Hicks]</i>. 
The best, and certainly most elaborately worked out, example of the general
concept is the mathematical economic analysis, running in terms of demand and
supply, or demand or supply, determined by the price of all other commodities,
which gives you a series of equations.  Since you have as many equations as you
have unknowns or items in the equations, you can always find the numerical
evaluation of any one in terms of the others.  It takes various forms with
various techniques: Cassel’s is cost, Hicks’s is indifference analysis.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            What we have is cost, as
well as utility, in terms of alternative utility in such analysis.  Then,
ostensibly, the problem of the missing middle between utility and disutility is
erased, and we have what is generally attributed to the neoclassicists in
economic theory: the difficulties involved in the utility-disutility
bifurcation on a common attribute measurable in common terms, that is to say,
price.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The fundamental
philosophical question involved, of course, is troublesome in that utility and
disutility are clearly identified as different kinds of experience, not
different degrees of the same kind of experience.  The whole history of the
question of value has proceeded into a bifurcation, a resolution always called
the great synthesis, an evidential demonstration of the <i>[unity of utility
and disutility:] </i>inadequacy, nihilism, bifurcation, synthesis, nihilism,
etc.  That has occurred some four or five times within written history.  And it
is because of the missing middle <i>[--a discontinuity that is eliminated by a
synthesis.]</i>  The synthesis gets rid of the missing middle, and is
accomplished in that fashion.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            We have utility and
disutility being conceived, in the earlier stages of this kind of analysis, as
two different kinds of things: pleasure and pain.  The resolution of it, the
synthesis, was attained through the mathematical analysis.  Its early stages in
the hands of Jevons didn’t seem to attain a real synthesis because it left so
many problems unsolved.  ....  The real synthesis came later, by making both
pleasure and pain utilities.  Costs are not a different kind of thing.  In this
sense you have a missing middle, not minus and plus, but disutility and
utility.  The synthesis is constituted by doing away with the Stoics: it is not
painful, but when there is more of something you don’t experience  <i>[abstinence,
opportunity cost]</i> than of something you do experience, you have thereby
sacrificed value, that is, utility.  You have experienced a “real” cost, with a
unified concept of what constitutes value.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Thus the synthesis.  The
problems that arise by virtue of the difference in character between pleasure
and pain is erased.  The minus aspect is what has been foregone in human
experience by virtue of the operations looking toward the plus
aspect--utility.  That is the character of the new utilitarianism, as contrasted
with primitive hedonism, the reason being--again coming out of economics into
philosophy and the other social sciences--that the problems arising in setting
up the equational analysis in this stage of utilitarianism resulted in some
very embarrassing answers--Karl Marx.  And so the economists speak of this kind
of analysis as real cost analysis--real cost as different from real rewards. 
And here it is comparative costs, costs being the same thing as rewards.  Thus,
you can set up a theory of wages measuring disutility and utility by the same
units because they are the same thing. It is other things foregone, you see.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Ostensibly, this solved
the problem of the missing middle by reducing both supply and demand to
utility--comparative utility of any given means of experience to other means of
experience both conceived in these terms.  But does this solve the problem? 
Quite clearly, it will fit comparative consumer prices if the rest of the
circle be given, like any other commodity price.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            But--trying to help the
devil prove his case--what determines <i>[the equilibrium relationship in
comparative cost analysis]</i>?  These supply and demand schedules still look
just as they did to Smith or Ricardo or Mill.  But they are conceived so as to
avoid the problem of discontinuity between utility and disutility.   ....  The
theory of wages, for example. You get marginal revenue or the marginal utility
of all objects or of any commodity you want, either one.  In this case,
labor--and the marginal disutility of working conceived as what you could do
other than work rather than the pain of working.  The real cost is not the
pain; it is what you could have done other than work.  You could have gone
fishing, etc.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Given all this, we have
two questions to answer, and if we can’t answer them, what do we mean by the
significance of this theory?  Do we mean that it explains something?  If so,
what?  Well, we have a definite equational expression, given the accuracy of
all the schedules.  If the schedules change, we will have new relative exchange
ratios among the means of experience.  We will obtain equilibrium at some other
point.  But we haven’t explained anything in the sense that  it will help us
resolve problematic situations.  What is the old or the new picture good for? 
If it is completely without significance, why bother with it?  If social
science is to be restricted to simple description or definition or
identification, then what significance has it?</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Explanation is something
other than description.  And I would have you note that the very spokesmen who
insist that social science be restricted to a description of the run of the
facts are the most dismayed when anyone suggests that social science is in fact
worthless.  What, then, is their idea of significance?  Quite clearly they mean
that this picture allows, or at least helps, us to know what we ought to do. 
But “to do” means motion, activity, and the laws of motion would not describe
different equilibria.  They would have to be set up in terms of direction and
philosophies of change, as in the differential calculus.  That is to say, the
laws of motion would disclose to us why the picture is changing, and the “why”
would have to disclose the character of the process of the shift.  Such a
concept of process does not permit cutting a cross section here and a cross
section there and describing each (shades of John Bates Clark), and assuming
thereby that you have a theory of the process as Marshall tried to get at it. 
You don’t get dynamic by putting cross sections of the static closer together. 
You don’t understand why people change by taking their picture more
frequently.  The data you record in frequent photography might be valuable in
working out the theory of growth or of change, but they don’t disclose to you
the theory of change.  And they quite clearly don’t constitute a theory of
change.  ....</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            What I have said in
substance is that significance in  the analysis of the social process
inescapably involves valuations.  The process, as these spokesmen admit,
constantly involves what goes on in the minds of--I would say “man,” they would
say “the entrepreneur,” “economic man,” the man whose decisions eventuate in
this or that.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            What is wrong with the
theory of mathematical equilibrium in so far as explanation is concerned? 
Accepting their specifications for the universe under consideration--in this
instance, the determination of the character and the rate of provision of the
means of human experience--unquestionably relative exchange ratios in anybody’s
economy are very important.  They determine the extensive area of the character
of the means of human life and experience, and therefore determine the
character of that actual life and experience.  Then what is the difficulty? 
Offhand it seems the approach is progressive.  It has a single criterion of
judgment, and thus ostensibly avoids the problem of the bifurcated connotation
of utility and disutility.  We have a way to compare one quantity of utility
with another quantity of utility and, thus, satisfactorily arrive at a
just--and therefore proper--exchange ratio and, therefore, a just determination
of the character of the means of life and, therefore, a just determination of
the character of human experience over any given time period.  Then what is
wrong, given the equational theory of price and of justice, or the equational
theory of justice and the equilibrium theory of price, and given the imputed
significance--though denied by the major spokesmen for the theory--,and given
the specifications of the universe of relative prices?  Let us look at it in
relation to the specific example of the theory of wages to see what is wrong.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'><b>lecture eighteen</b></p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Last time we indicated the
significant import of the equilibrium concept, particularly as it is thought to
be susceptible to mathematical expression by virtue of decisions of persons who
exchange items which have that attribute--utility.  We noted that this
expression attains the determination of justice and, therefore, propriety in
the character of production and the quantity of production; and since the
character and quantity of the means of life <i>[determine]</i> the character of
experience, <i>[equilibrium specifies]</i> the social process itself.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Then we asked ourselves
the question of what is wrong, if anything, with this effort to avoid the
difficulties in the bifurcation of the plus-minus aspects of it which make it
amenable to determination of equilibrium in mathematical terms, that is to say,
using mathematical language.  We had <i>[said that]</i> almost all economic
theory is drawn in those terms, the only <i>[measurement of which]</i> being,
in economics, that of price, the price theory of valuation.  It is used by
other social scientists in other terms--certainly by the<i> [political
scientists] </i>and sociologists and anthropologists in most part--the idea
that people seek satisfaction, which we had already noted in the most elaborate
presentation, that of the marginal utility analysis in economics.  It looks
like hardly more than a description of a situation, allowing no possibility, at
least offering difficulty, in getting to what those theorists usually call a
“dynamic” explanation or expression in terms of process, the general procedure
in that instance being chronologically very frequent cross sections so close
together that you can draw a trend.  And statistical analysis, you will note,
uses that construct very extensively, and where correlations are established,
it would seem to be a valid tool.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            That is especially true in
the examination of phenomena that do not involve the exercise of discretion,
that is to say, immediately applicable in the area we call physical science. 
The difficulties arise by virtue of this attribute we call reason, and thus the
choice-making function, and I fear that most of the mistakes made in
statistical matters are a result of forgetting that human beings differ from
other items, relationships between which may be analyzed through the use of
that tool.  It seems to me that the problem at that point has not been
sufficiently examined to make any very reasonable judgments about where that
kind of operation is valid and where it is not valid.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Where valuation is taking
place about non-evaluating items, it is simply and clearly a problem primarily
of mathematics, technique of expression so as to bring into view the determinants
of the problem simultaneously, so to speak.  But in the case of an analysis of
the correlated behavior or the interrelationships among evaluating
items--persons--another element is introduced which seems to me to do fatal
violence in many instances to the application of this same theory.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>STUDENT:<i> [Can’t you use the theory
of probability with large numbers?]</i></p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Yes, and of course that is
done.  The difficulty is that your problem almost always should not involve
infinite numbers.  To get to confident predictions through that technique, the
numbers required for the theory of probability to give confidence is larger
than the number of persons who are involved in an institutional situation.  In
the case of an individual family , or in the case of a particular wage dispute,
the <i>[statistical] </i>correlation of various items which are variant through
previously observed sequences, the simple function of which is identical with
the one under examination, will not tell you what will happen, even though your
previous experience has been the correlation of 100% positive.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            I think the theory of
probability applies, certainly, but the problem is really not one of <i>[statistics]</i>,
your problem is one of examining and determining what is involved in and what
constitutes and what determines the evaluative process.  The fact of valuation
on the part of the items being examined, it seems to me, changes the
assumptions, changes the items about which the assumptions are made in the case
of non-evaluating items like molecules or worms or something.  So the real
problem you have to solve is not the problem you attack when you apply that
kind of statistical measurement to non-evaluating items.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            With humans, the problem
is always one of determining the process of evaluation before you can proceed
with the statistical tools of the items about which you presumably know its
behavior evaluationally-wise, which is always the case in non-human or, at
least, in non-animal activity.  It is always true of machinery, but it is never
true of human beings.  You have a doubtful area all the way down, depending on
the complexity of the evaluating activity that goes on in the living organism. 
Of course, we all know that in some sense or other almost all living organisms
evaluate.  Plants diverge by virtue of encountering certain stimuli, and they
don’t all diverge the same.  There are individual differences.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>STUDENT:<i> “Would you mind
[repeating] that again?  I seem to think that you said there was a degree of
predictability in machines that there isn’t in humans, and I’m sure I didn’t
catch it.”</i></p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'><i>            </i>Well, I’m sure you
didn’t too.  The range of predictability in human behavior, I should say, is of
course the same range--exactly what it is in the case of electron analysis, or
stellar bodies, or chairs.  Exactly: it is from zero to complete confidence. 
In the case of human behavior it has the same range.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            That wasn’t the point I
was discussing at all.  The point I was trying to make was the realization that
the assumption underlying the application of this tool we call the “trend,”
which is simply a particular application of the theory of probability, becomes
invalid when it is applied to relations between evaluating items, since it is
drawn on the assumption that there is a non-evaluating situation among the items
the relationship of which is under investigation.  It is the process of
evaluating that invalidates the presumption involved in the application of the
central-tendency idea.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            We can go farther than
that, I think.  We can say that in any problematic situation in which it would
appear desirable to apply that tool to the analysis of a particular problem--if
you want to apply it to some aspect of the social process which appears to be
incomplete or something is out of order or something like that--in the case of
human beings you first have to work out the problem of value and evaluating
before you can apply that technique.  The technique is applied just like it is
in physical science.  It is applied as if we in fact do know the outcome of
each individual item’s response to the forces which comprise the data of the
problem.  We don’t.  That is my point.    We don’t unless we understand the
theory of value, the theory of valuation, and the data which that theory
indicates in relation to that particular item being investigated.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            And a third point which I
think we can see is that in collecting those data we do not, we cannot, be
guided by the theory of probability itself, nor by the theory as it is applied
in physics, because of the difference in character of the operation.  An
example of that appeared in an MBA degree examination I sat in on, in which the
student had a minor in statistics.   One of his professors happened to notice a
chart in the room which showed the experience of haberdashery retail business over
some twelve to fourteen years, and asked him to make an estimate of the
correlation between the two variables involved; one was retail price, the other
I forgot.  The student guessed it pretty accurately at about 85%.  Then it
occurred to me that both the questioner and the candidate thought that was
significant.  I said, “Take a period in the highest correlation, from year X to
Y; you’re in the business, and this is the run of the facts.  You’re going to
use this knowledge of correlations to determine what you are going to do this
week. In the fall of this year, you have to decide how much and what kind of
what to buy.  The positive correlation here is pretty high, better than .8. 
Are you going to increase your stock, or are you going to decrease your inventory?” 
Well, he immediately saw the point, of course.  What would happen is if he had,
he would have been bankrupt within a matter of a couple of months.  And
bankruptcy to business is sort of like death to an individual organism; you
aren’t any more</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            My point was that you
can’t predict the actions of human beings that way, unless you know why that
correlation was established.  And that “why” is the constant presence of
evaluation in the process and the determinants of that evaluating process.  The
general principles necessarily have to continue, but the data that those
principles identify suddenly reverse themselves at that point, and the
correlation for a short period of boom is gone.  It is reversed.  You can’t
predict that way, by virtue of the fact that human beings evaluate, unless and
until you get the data which are not disclosed in such charts, those data being
dictated by what is involved in the evaluative process.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Some time ago, we had
illustrated utility and disutility in retrospect in which we had a bifurcation
of two different things.  It seemed to be a necessity of real cost analysis,
the last determinants of it being the disutility analysis in the <i>[neo]</i>classical
development in economic theory, along with positive utility in the earlier stages
of the utilitarian doctrine, usually referred to as hedonism, and the
reconciliation of that missing-middle situation by making this conceivable in
these terms.  Thus the synthesis.  That is what Marshall was supposed to have
done for the civilized community, and then on into philosophy and the social
sciences, the familiar graphical presentation of it as it appears in economics
as a determination of equilibrium price.  And you can set that up in terms of
comparative equilibrium price for any number of items, and through the
equations represented by these schedules get the equilibrium point on both
these axes--price or measuring unit, and quantity--between any two commodities.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            That is raised to the
level of general principle somewhat in this wise.  As everyone knows, the
economic process doesn’t stop, and in this sense you might represent it by
circles and start anywhere you want.  Start at consumption, and all the things
that go on in the economic process resulting in more consumption, resulting in energy,
etc., round and round, resulting in more consumption.  The theories centered on
the theory of progress and how that circle got larger and larger, and thus it
takes such forms as the Austrian development of roundaboutness, which is
farther from any point you want to start at, and go back to that position. 
More indirect operations in the circle enlarge the community’s--and thus each
individual's--economic life and then society’s life generally by virtue of the
experience in it--the theory of capital formation making use of the
development.  You can start where you want to , it doesn’t make any difference
in this analysis.  The neoclassical theory can be stated quite as well from one
point in the circle as the other.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Somewhere around here, you
have two stages involved in which this difference becomes a real problem--the
one of wages, in which you’re getting the equilibrium identified between this
and this, or this and this, presumably in this and this, already having
recognized the difficulty in here.  Granting the attainment of <i>[equilibrium]</i>,
and granting all the assumptions that go with it, then examine a position in
this circle which involves, on the one hand, human experience which is
completely in conformity with this basic idea, because all points on this
circle are reducible in this theory to those terms.  It is not the physical
matters that are determined, it is the human incidence.  And what human
incidence?  Utility.  And utility can be defined in such a manner as to make
that, in fact, a truism, where it is necessarily so.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            My point will be that what
you get then is a chronological presentation of a cross section of the
situation which you purport to explain.  And it becomes most apparent at two
points ... when what that point is reducible to in the economic process is what
you began with.  That <i>[situation] </i>is most easily observable in the case
of consumer goods and in the case of wages.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            This buying of labor.  In
the case of wages, in Marshall’s terms set up as an equilibrium position
between the schedule of the marginal productivity of labor and the schedule of
the marginal disutility of working.  It is no different in any other social
science except, in this case, there is interposed a price theory of valuation
which gives you equilibration on this <i>[quantity]</i> axis, which avoids this
difficulty by applying this concept in these terms.  Now this <i>[supply]</i>
schedule is presented on the assumption that, as anywhere else along here, the
alternative foregone <i>[by working is the utility of not working]</i>--which
is true as long as you are trading a commodity for a commodity.  In the
purchase of human labor, there are no<i> [positive alternatives] </i>involved. <i> [The</i>
<i>worker]</i> can buy white bread or rye bread or whatever, but when you buy
human labor, what are your alternatives?  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            This<i> [labor supply
curve]</i> is set up like any other application of price theory, as if the
alternative were what is presented here.  The assumption is that<i> [the
worker] </i>has the alternative between working and not working, and that
certainly is true, isn’t it?  You don’t <u>have</u> to work, you can starve to
death, if you want to.  But it isn’t starvation that is presented as the
alternative, because then it wouldn’t be in this shape.  I presume that you
would hate to starve to death at one time as much as at another time.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            When you take away real
cost analysis and get to comparative cost analysis, which seems to have
resolved the problem inherent in this bifurcation, you get yourself into the
difficulty that I’m trying to focus on now.  What is the alternative to work? 
What is assumed positive here is leisure, isn’t it?  And of course, as all of
you who have had economics courses with me in which this arises know, that
isn’t an alternative to employment at all.  Leisure, with very slight
reflection--and how it has missed the economists beats me--is an attribute of
employment, not an alternative to employment.  It is an alternative to working
when you are employed. It’s an alternative available to those who have
placement in the institutional structure we call employment.  As a descriptive
fact, it is not an attribute of unemployment at all.  That’s why we have always
thought that unemployment wasn’t leisurely at all.  It is the most not-<i>[leisurely]
</i>that you can imagine.  In the case of non-availability of alternative
placement in the economic structure, so as to receive income--which is the
presumption </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>of the theory we are
considering--there is <i>[no leisure]</i> involved, yet all of it is “not
working.”  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The assumption is that not
working and leisure are the same thing, and in fact they are not.  What we mean
by leisure in these terms is an attribute of employment, meaning, of course, as
the man on the street has always known, when you have a job, the time you are
not working is the time you’re off the job.  You get off at 3 PM, and then you
are at leisure until the next morning when you go back to work.  But if you
don’t start to work the next morning, if you aren’t placed in the institutional
structure in that fashion, you’re not at leisure from 3 until 9 the next
morning.  You don’t have that experience during that time.  What you have is
something different.  If you have a job, you just love to get off.  But if you
are unemployed, you hate to see 3 PM come just as much as you hate to see 9 AM
come--in these terms.  But if the terms are different in your alternatives,
you’ve got these problems.  And these problems already have been proven fatal
by the very spokesman of this theory.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            So what are you going to
do, when half of the equation is human life?  And that’s true of the price
determination of consumer goods as well as wages.  In the case of wages, half
of it is direct human experience.  There is nothing in between, so that you do
not have the alternative of imputation of the price theory of valuation through
the price theory of valuation that you do in the case of commodities.  In the
case of consumer goods, half of the equation is human life.  The alternative to
consuming is death, and death is not measurable in foregone utility.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            We have always known that,
when you get down to rock bottom, the practical actualities of human experience
<i>[are]</i> that human life has no price.  It is priceless.  We have always
known that it doesn’t fit the utility theory of value, and no one has ever
questioned that.  Yet, I will have you note in view of what we said last time,
that if this theory’s significance is not human life, then it has none at all. 
The commodity doesn’t make any difference, as John Stuart Mill explains very
carefully.  It is its impact in terms of human life that makes the difference,
that establishes that equilibrium.  And it is presumed that human behavior is
already known as chronologically anterior to the application of the theory of
probability to the <i>[supply and demand of labor]</i>.  And it isn’t.  Now, my
point is this: you cannot determine wages this way.  It can be shown, as John
Maynard Keynes shows beyond any shadow of a doubt in anybody’s mind, that that<i>
[supply]</i> schedule does not exist.  He puts it up so pat that it is a
truism, and everyone agrees that all truisms are true.  But they are sort of
ridiculous if you try to make them something other than a truism.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The same thing is true in
the determination of prices of consumer goods.  When you reach the point where
the alternatives are in fact the inclusive ones, between consuming and not
consuming, your whole pattern of presumptions falls to pieces.  Everybody knows
that when that is the set of alternatives, there are none.  There can be no
choice between life and death.  That’s why this whole recent question of
allowing a physician to make a judgment in the case of a particular patient is
absurd.  Of course he cannot, and we cannot allow it on very valid, evidential,
scientific grounds.  You can’t do it that way.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            And if wages and consumer
prices are not to be fitted <i>[into the circle of the economic process]</i>--and
note that they occur all the way around here: always labor is being purchased,
always consumers are buying products, always production, final stage, is being
turned into human life, into human experience.   You eat it and wear it
out--and some things don’t even do that.  The more you use it the more you
have, like music and love and bubble gum.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>             You can’t <i>[use the
comparative cost analysis]</i>.  You have to make an imputation around every<i>
[proposed alternative]</i>.  And you don’t know whether that line runs off down
here in these terms, or whether it just goes right on down there, do you?  You
can’t fit the theory of wages into this business.  And I use the theory of
wages an an item because it is in the literature, demonstrably, and so far as I
know completely without refutation, as incompatible with <i>[comparative cost
analysis]</i>.  But if you go back to<i> [real cost]</i>, you encounter fatal
difficulties to the general theory, you are applying, and you’re bankrupt
again.  Thus nihilism.  And what has occurred in response to the synthesis that
has come out of the recognition of the problems involved here has been a
tendency toward nihilism, and the impossibility of the application of the
nihilistic pattern of intellectual operations to real problems has resulted in
the <i>[birth]</i> of any number of positivisms, from fascism to
existentialism.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            So when we ask, for
example, what sacrifices the laborer makes which fit this specification, you
will find that there are none.  Labor, then, is not a commodity except in the
sense of one attribute: it is purchased and sold.  The fact seems to me to be
clear that unemployment does not have positive utility.  Then what is the
alternative which gets labor started around in the circle?  In the
mathematically equilibrated relationships that we have set up--and I certainly
think it is a very valuable tool in analyzing the referential content
represented by that circle--there is such a process, you know.  If those gaps
are to be bridged over, can we grant the assumptions upon which the general
theory is built?  If not, then how can all prices be defined in terms of all
other prices of that circle?  You have to have as many equations as you have
unknowns, and you have as many unknowns as you have commodities.  At least two
of these items in the circle don’t fit.  You have two more unknowns than you
have equations.  And those two--prices of consumer goods and price of
labor--don’t have a commodity intervening which gives them a common attribute
of measurement.  ....</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            So you can’t, it seems to
me, apply the utility theory of value even through the concept of equilibrium,
as giving you direction of analysis and arrangement of data for analysis.  The
data aren’t there in two of your equations.  You come up with an equation like
this: x + what = what?  And I suggest that you can’t solve that equation.  The
reason is that one of the “whats” isn’t there.  When you have more unknowns
than equations, you are wasting your time.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'><b>lecture nineteen</b></p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>STUDENT:  <i>“You indicated yesterday
that any decision like mercy-killing would in fact be an irrational decision. 
You couldn’t make a rational choice to follow that course of action.”</i></p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            That’s right.  There are
any number of ways of putting it.  Perhaps the most succinct way is this: so
long as one is alive, it means (incidentally, this is the same problem as in
suicide exactly--<i>[the choice] </i>between life and death) he is operating at
some level of efficiency.  It may well be that, to him as an individual, it is
intolerable.  The pain may be excruciating.  The interruption of his
faculties--and particularly his intellectual faculties--may be such as to make
him wish for death, and he may beg his friends to destroy him, or the community
or his friends might consider it on their own.  But the fact remains, and it is
a fact, that he is operating at some level of efficiency, and the choice to
destroy is zero in preference to that level.  That’s the inclusive way of
putting it, I think.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            There are other ways and
other items which might help substantiate the position which seems to me to be
irrefutable.  You don’t know the determinants of the future in the
technological sense, including the individual’s physiognomy, and you know that
you don’t know.  Some of the greatest contributions to civilization in the
whole development have come from persons for whom that decision would appear at
first blush as rational as could be made.  In the application of an
instrumental theory of value, that decision is impossible.  In the effort to
apply the utility theory of value, that decision may be made.  But happiness is
not the end of life.  As Einstein once explained, it is fit for a criterion of
judgment only for a herd of cattle.  And I am sure that cattle are much happier
than most persons, in the ordinary sense of the word happy; they have fewer
irresolvable problems (and that is what produces unhappiness) than have human
beings.  They are content, but who wants to be a cow?  I think maybe a buzzard
ought to be the happiest of all animals, but I don’t want to be a buzzard.  And
to wish to decide to die, or to decide on your own or on someone else’s death
is a decision to be less than a buzzard.  It is a decision to be less than a
paramecium.  It is a decision to be nothing.  And nothing, I suggest, is always
less than something, no matter how little something is</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            There can be no rational
decision to kill anybody, either yourself or anyone else.  It can be very
difficult to see when you are in a situation yourself in which the basis of
reference for the problems at hand is extremely camouflaged by thunder and
lightning, etc., in your own feelings.  When you feel alone, when you are cut
off from the basis of reference, from the social process, when you are cut off
particularly by emotional dislocation and, therefore, in the extremist <i>[isolation]</i>,
then it is very difficult to think about the matter.  You get frightened and
disturbed.  And by disturbance, I mean disruption of the rational processes. 
And you get to where you don’t care.  What you mean by “don’t care” is that you
cease to be rational.  And in that condition, you can choose death.  It is the
wrong choice, necessarily the wrong choice!  Either for yourself or for anyone
else.  Society cannot permit on quite other grounds any individual to make
it--logically, society cannot permit them to destroy other members of a
community unless it can be proven that their existence threatens to destroy the
community.  And that has never been proven.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Capital punishment is an
irrational institution.  We don’t know the future.  You can’t allow it on
another basis: a person having discretion over life and death of other persons,
having the power to pronounce one or the other, to choose for other persons
that alternative which is not a genuine alternative.  Note that all
alternatives are items within the life process.  There are no alternatives
outside of the life process, so far as social value is concerned.  Dead people
make no choices socially.  There is no choice, therefore, between nothing and
something.  If alternatives mean anything, they have to both be positive.  That
is simply a question of the problem we have been considering the last two hours
in the bifurcation of the criterion of judgment.  A choice between something
and less than something is not a choice.  Choices are between somethings.  So
to act as if you were trying to make a choice between something and nothing is
nonsense.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            There are other grounds:
an individual who is given discretion over another person’s life or not-life
must be remembered to be himself a choice-making individual, and he must be
remembered to be subject to all the incidences--both invidiously and
instrumentally--that other persons are subject to.  This is what is wrong with
government by the experts, you see, no matter how they are trained.  The
question then arises of ultimate (if the word has any meaning in this regard)
power.  Discretion--complete discretion--over other persons; power to decide
that other persons don’t exist.  If any power is final, that power is final. 
And remember that as an institution where there is a plurality of persons
involved in each position in the institutional structure, that person will have
a tendency to act in terms of his power louder than in terms of the instrumental
decisions and problems at hand.  And that is where the two come in conflict, he
is apt to ask of himself right questions and get the wrong answers through this
device which has grown up, especially in the United States, called compromise,
which is an attic door with a ring of justice to it.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            By compromise, of course,
what has occurred throughout the history of man is that he maintains his power
even though he knows better.  And always the compromise is on this score: that
if he doesn’t, someone else will.  And since he will do it better than some
scoundrel, he has to do it.  That is the most direct, and nearly certainly the
most ceremonially adequate basis for that kind of behavior.  And you find it
over and over again.  I saw a governor of a state weep on that score, because
he knew what he was doing was wrong, but he felt he had to do it.  Well, the
fact is that he didn’t have to do it.  What he meant was that if he didn’t do
it, those scoundrels would, and they wouldn’t do anything but that.  I told him
he was wrong, and he was.  You can’t believe something you know darn well isn’t
so.</p>

community?”</i></p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Yes.  But to choose death
to erase that impediment is to disallow all other alternatives, and the only
place that is in fact disallowed is in self-defense.  It is not true that there
are no alternatives other than life or death, except in defense.  When a man
tries to kill you, the position arises in which you have  a choice between your
life and his.  But in no other instance do you have that choice.  In no other
instance are those alternatives the only ones.  ....</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            A man stands before a
judge for sentence, a sentence for conviction of the most heinous crimes you
can imagine--and they have all been committed.  The judge has other
alternatives besides life or death to that man in reference to the security of
the community.  This man is in such a condition that, if you turn him loose in
the streets, he starts killing everybody he sees right away.  And there are
people who are that way.  They just like it, think it is fun.  You still have
another alternative for the protection of the community and the social
process.  However, when a man is approaching you on the battlefield with a
bayonet, it is a different matter.  That is why a decision to wage war cannot
be made on rational grounds.  A decision to defend yourself in war <u> must</u>
be made if you are to proceed on rational grounds. Pacifism has no foundation
in fact.  Aggression is always invalid.  Defense is always valid.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            ....  If it were not true
that defense is rational behavior, then there would be no social process,
because there always are persons who like to destroy.  There is nothing easier

the case of a declared war, in which each side has proclaimed and demonstrated,
and it is accepted by all parties involved in the institution of war with
complete confidence that everyone is operating under the same immediate
motivation--that is a situation in which it is in fact true that an attack may
be a defense.  But in a situation in which everyone denies that he intends to
kill everybody, to assume that everyone does intend to kill everyone is in
error.  ....  Now, that much I have said frequently in regard to the cold-war
situation, that if it were true, in fact, that Russia eventually would try to
destroy the United States, then you must conclude immediately that you must
attack Russia tonight, with everything you’ve got.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Now, no one who talks as
if they want war with Russia is willing to do it now.  No one thinks he is
prepared to make that decision now,and correctly so.  Those persons don’t want
war with Russia.  They want a continuation of a differentiated pattern of <i>[income
distribution]</i> in the U.S.  They aren’t fighting for a war with Russia. 
They are scared to death of a war with Russia.  ....  What they want is a
continued favored position in this economy.  And the problem internally can be
very well camouflaged if enough noise is made about the wolf over on the other
side of the hill.  It’s an old, old human trait.  If you can get people to look
up at the stars, you can walk by unnoticed.  And if you can get people
frightened of something over the hill, they forget that you are bad.  And when
the community begins to notice that you are really bad ..., you will find
accompanying the recognition of guilt, a very loud inclination to draw
attention elsewhere.  ....  The art of camouflage, a form of the moron’s

around the world, in view of the fact that both contending parties view this
set of facts: that until ways are found in which or through which the two
communities can correlate their behavior to the benefit of both, the prime
function of the responsible individuals in both communities is to make sure
that the other community does not gain the right to resolve the pattern of that
correlated behavior, that is to say, to be sure that in any eventuality you
will be able to defend yourself against their arbitrary decision of your fate. 
The U.S. State Department is largely charged with that function at the moment,
realizing that in case of an actual effort of an authoritarian dictation, ...
the eventuation of the physical struggle that necessarily results is a problem
of what the other two billion people in the world feel and think. Who wins the

ought to be done about it.  But it is a complicated operation.  I don’t know
how you would go about it.  Most social analysts don’t have the emotional power
to experience it anyway...</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Last time I indicated that
I should like to discuss this matter of the comparative isolation of social
problems in relation to the total complex of institutions within which the
problem arises.  What I wanted to get you to see is the relationship between
that and the personal problem and the lack of synonymy between the two.  And,
as I indicated, this involves an articulate comprehension of the second
principle of institutional adjustment in some preview sense.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            All social problems, of
course, involve disrapport, dislocation, conceived some way or
other--non-fittingness, something missing or incomplete.  When that occurs in a
social process, in a system of institutions ...  Let’s say these are different
institutions, blocks of which we separately identify, all of them made up of
still smaller institutions, etc.  All of them comprising the total complex of
interrelated patterns.  When we get large areas of that in terms of persons and
patterns, we speak of it as culture, do we not?  A matter of the culture.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Now, problems social in
character are always arising within this process.  Incidentally, now it is
quite clear that the whole world is interrelated in many institutional
ways--particularly economic.  Events on<i> [an island]</i> in the Southwest
Pacific affect what happens in the lady’s dining room in New York, and the
stock market, and the price of coconuts, you see.  We are in fact a world
economy in a very real sense.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Now a problem arises,
let’s say, in this institution.  It goes without saying that you cannot do
something about something which you don’t know something about.   You cannot
make choices when those choices are not within your area of discretion.  And it
seems to me that there are two ways in which this exclusion of possible
alternatives can occur.  The primary one is a matter of understanding: <i>[when]</i>
you can’t see the connections between the problematic situation at hand and
institutional factors which are in fact related to it.  Example: American labor
vote.  They aren’t bargaining for wages; they are trying to get more money per
unit of labor.  And they bargain about it, and each uses whatever coercive
stratagem is at hand.  Finally, they come to some sort of an agreement, and the
agreement we call a bargain.  Both sides agree.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            In 1948, American labor
was asking for something which destroyed the effect it hoped to obtain through
obtaining<i> [higher wages]</i>.  We were very close to the M point <i>[of true
inflation]</i> in that year.  Labor got in some measure what it was asking for,
and the results were exactly opposite of what it hoped to obtain through
getting what it asked for.  And that bewildered them.  They were doing what
they knew how to do: asking for more money.  And management was doing what it
knew how to do--it has always done it that way--asking for less money for
wages--for employees other than management.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Always before (with the
possible exception of about 30 days in 1920) we had been operating far this
side of the M point and, therefore, it had always been true that what they
asked for eventuated in what they wanted: a higher standard of living.  When
they could get what they asked for--more money per unit of labor--it always
resulted in their getting what they wanted--a higher standard of living, a more
extensive participation in civilization, more of the means of human experience,
higher real income.  But now it resulted in exactly the contrary because of the
difference in economic relationships ... between prices of labor and prices of
other things.  They didn’t understand the M point; they didn’t know that such a
thing existed.  It was never mentioned until last year in the University of
Denver <i>[Gladys Myers Foster, &quot;The M point &amp; the theory of real
Y.&quot; Master's thesis June 1949].</i></p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Now what can they do? 
....  Nothing, in the sense of applying theory available to them.  What
happened<i> [was]</i> they tried it a few times and got a few rounds of wage
increases, and prices rose a little more each time than wages.  Now labor
said,  “Just a minute!”  We have been thinking this way, but it isn’t so;
something is wrong.  It seems that when we get these <i>[wage]</i> increases it
increases effective demand too much.  How can we get more without getting an
increase in effective demand more than the increase in wages?  Offhand it
seemed the only way was to get more money; that is the way you get “things” in
our community.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            But<i> [our community has]</i>
thought up some odd things--like Social Security items, vacations, casualty
protection, insurance--all sort of things, but no more money, you see.  Let’s
suppose (this is hypothetical, but not altogether divorced from the run of the
facts)<i> [the unions]</i> were successful in getting some of these things,
while in the meantime other things happened that pulled <i>[aggregate demand]</i>
back down from the M point.  ....  Other things happened which shifted the
level of employment down to about here.  What really happened was that the
population increased during the period and just stretched this line way out, so
labor then operated there.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Then they had the same
problem under a different set of circumstances, a set of circumstances which
led them originally to apply for more money wages always.  Then let’s say they
are successful for the next two or three years, with increasing unemployment,
in getting more non-market-effect real income.  ....  Then the market impact of
their original attainment begins to take effect in the form of effective demand
in the market, and prices go up at the same time that they are not getting
increases in real income.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            This is what is happening
to American labor today.  They are beginning to say, “Now, wait a minute!  Last
year it looked like we would get a higher income if we could get all wages down
uniformly, or at least not let them get up any more, and get our gains through
non-take-home pay which would affect the market in the form of consumer demand,
and thus raise prices through the action of the multiplier effect. Now we’ve
done the other thing, and real wages are going down again.  What’s wrong?” 
They still don’t know about it.  But suppose they did understand that.  Then
their course of action to attain what they want--a higher level of
participation in civilization--would involve a different course of behavior
than has ever been followed.  They would not then sit down across the table and
bargain, and stop there.  To attain what they want to attain, they will have to
analyze this <i>[M-point variable]</i>, and then try to do some things to this <i>[variable]</i>
to get what they want that used to come out of the simple operation <i>[of
bargaining]</i> by virtue of the long-continued level of employment below the M
point.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            So far, my point would be
this: that no economic problem is isolated from any other aspect of the
economy, in fact.  That is what we mean by an economy: that all of the products
are economically interrelated.  That’s what constitutes an economy.  And we
have said that the economy now is, in a very definite way, worldwide.  You
might still find some autonomous, as it were, economics in a smaller size.  You
might find some in which complete autarchy exists.  But they would have to be
very primitive cultures.  They couldn’t have the means of experience that we
are familiar with.  You can’t, therefore, isolate a problem in fact.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            But every economic problem
is, in that sense, isolated.  Every time the smallest thing is wrong in any
aspect of the social process, you can’t go all over the world and all over all
social processes and institutions, and make all adjustments--as if you were
omniscient--that would result in the perfect alleviation of the problematic
situation.  It just can’t be done.  One of the specifications of the area of
consideration of the problem is the one I have indicated--<i>[the M point]</i>. 
You have to know about it.  If labor understood all that it seems to me labor
now could understand, their behavior would be very different than it now is. 
Understanding is one of the determinants of the area of consideration of
alternatives.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'><b>lecture twenty-one</b></p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Last time we were
considering the matter of the equilibrium concept--how the utilitarian
application works out through it--and we found that it doesn’t work.  We found
also an effort to explain the economic process in that fashion. It results, at
best, in a way of presenting an individual situation as of a particular moment,
and offers no way to get at the dynamic, the process aspect.  In fact, I should
say that it helps very little in extensive explanation.  In some instances--for
example, the direct comparative estimation of human instances of consumer goods
and wages, or the price of labor--we found that it offers not only no
explanation, but no  definition.  It does not offer identification because the
conditions of the analysis are not present.  Which ought to lead us to suspect
the analysis in some wise, by virtue of the character of the difficulties
involved in <i>[assuming]</i> positive-negative aspects in terms of difference
in kinds of human experiences, not only degrees.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The resolution of the
problems which arise in the bifurcations of the concept of human motivation, I
think, cannot be successfully attained in terms of utility at any stage in the
development of that theory.  I can see some possibilities of explaining
comparative price, not in terms of utility but using price as a theory of valuation
with a different theory of value.  Of course, the significance of price theory
as it now stands is that it is evaluational theory appertaining to the utility
theory of value.  I suggest further that the search in those terms seems
hopeless; we cannot attain applicable theory.  That is to say, we can find no
way through that kind of theory to a formulation of a comprehension which would
permit us to solve problems with which we are necessarily confronted.  So I
would suggest its abandonment for that purpose.  I am not here suggesting its
abandonment for whatever purposes can be accounted for by it--I don’t know what
they are, if any.  What it comes to is, the reason it is inapplicable is that
it is untrue and, as I hope you have already seen, applicability may be
discerned in terms of truth</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            That’s why, in the
original stages of our examination of this kind of theory, I suggested the
applicable and non-applicable distinction, because in a very real sense
applicability is inescapably conjoined with validity--applicability in the
sense of resolving problematic situations.  And as we have seen, there is no
escape from the compulsion toward that function.  And furthermore, that if
there be any other compulsions involved, I don’t know what they are.  No one has
ever pointed them out.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            However we go at an
application of the utility theory in any of its forms, we come out at the point
at which applications to the real problem confronted by real persons
necessarily occur, and it is not applicable, working into direct judgments of
human relationships in the form of the theory of justice.  Not applicable in
the sense that it does not offer any way to gather the data which disclose the
justification of the data--the resolution of problems involving justice.  In
the strictly economic sphere of the exchange of commodities and/or factors of
production, we find not only is it not applicable in the sense that it does not
result in any possibility of selecting the data and arranging them for
analysis--not only does it not do that, it also forbids that being done.  And
consequently it can very easily be reduced to the absurd--in parallel with the
example we recently used of the choice so-called between life and death--in
which a community, on the basis of the utility theory of value, could destroy
itself quite “rationally” in very trying circumstances, thereby negating all
human experience including the valuation one.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            And so we are left with
the necessity of filling that void.  That effort has been repeated over and
over again, of course, falling into one of two categories in relation to
rational behavior: one, in which<i> [there is an a priori and arbitrary
assumption of an infinite number of teleological theories of value;  and two,
in which there is a one-choice theory of value and an infinite number of
theories of valuation.</i></p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'><i>            In the one]</i>, the
question of the beginning datum may be set forth arbitrarily, and then
formulations which work out into specifications of human behavior which
seemingly follow from it--in the John Stuart Mill sense of continuity, meaning
juxtaposition conceptually rather than similarity conceptually, chronologically
or otherwise--juxtaposition in such a fashion as to get at what we sometimes
now speak of as the William James problem of the nature of the cause.  In that
category, you can say anything you wish: “In the beginning there was ...” or
“At bottom there is this ...,” and then proceed accordingly either
positional-wise or similarity-wise, to <i>[explain]</i> “why” this sort of
thing.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Note that what we are
starting with here is the non-evidential determination of the basic data, and
since those data determine the character of your answers to all problems within
the known data of those problems, and since, as it were, one answer is as good
as another, then you can predetermine your answers by preselecting your data
and then choosing the criterion, or what results in the criterion, by choosing
the basic data accordingly.  That is to say, you can work your problems
backwards.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            I would suggest that is a
complete circumvention of the problem.  We say you can work your problems
backwards.  What we are saying, of course, is that you can select what you wish
would be an answer to the problems, to remain on safe ground, and work back
through analysis, disclosing at final conclusion the basic datum, or what Dewey
calls the “island of confidence” from which, then, in your demonstration of the
validity of that answer you may start, thus attain a true tautology; and thus
all non-evidentially determined value theory <u>necessarily </u>is a result of
the predilection of the answers to be attained to particular social problems
and/or personal problems.  I would dare say that no such formulation ever
emanated from the so-called “inherent propensity of man,” or from an
unfertilized original egg.  Formulations are bred by the experience men have in
the problems of actual human relationships and thus, for example, men
constantly are making God in their own image.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            In terms of applicability,
the criterion required cannot be of that character.  Nor can it fit the second
category, which does not rest upon either the presumption<i> [of teleology]</i>
involved in the first category or upon an evidentially established datum
in-and-of-itself, or what we call independent identification, which simply means
quite the contrary of the necessary way of saying it in the first instance. 
That is to say, in terms of relationships with other phenomena rather than
separate and apart from them--subject to identification other than in terms of 
itself.  That is to say, explanatory in excess of a truism.  To say that
something is itself doesn’t explain anything; indeed, it does not even identify
anything, if identity is to have any other meaning than a truism, and if so,
then rational inquiry is beside the point.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The utility theory of
value falls into the second category and is presumed to be evidentially
established by virtue of many observations of its actual involvement as the
motivation in human behavior.  I suggest, however, that if you will follow our
discussion of it in either direction from here back or from back here, you will
find it involved in the same tautology; that it  may be used--not by virtue of
its identification but by virtue of the character of the evaluation theory--to
prove anything you will care for me to prove.  Unlike the category one instance
I mentioned a moment ago, <i>[with]</i> utility theory the character of the
answers secured through effort at applying it is not determined by the
character of the concept of utility, as is the case in category one.  In the
case of utility--and this is its unique advantage, especially for propaganda
purposes, to say the least--anything can be proven with it.  Not by the
determination of the basic datum, but by the determination of how that basic
datum is determined, of how it is compared in terms of more or less as an
attribute of alternatives among which choices have to be made, so that if we
are to identify significance in terms of resolution<i> [of problems]</i>, ...
it involves something other than human discretion in terms of predilections or
wants or desires.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Then it seems to me that
it necessarily follows--and in human history has followed--that neither
category permits any possible recognition of significance at all--none at all
except as a mistake in human affairs may serve as an object lesson in what not
to do.  No problem--not even the minutest one--was ever solved in either
fashion, category one or category two.  The applicability of the infinite
variety of theories of value in category one, and the applicability of the
infinite variety of theories of valuation in category two--all separately and
cumulatively and combinedly--have exactly no significance as significance is
conceived in terms of resolution of real problems.  The only significance they
could have is the same significance that a disease has: it itself constitutes a
problem.  It is not the criterion of judgment.  It is not the way of going
about comparing items, alternatives in terms of good and bad, and cannot be. 
And so the criterion of judgment must be quite otherwise.  We are forbidden, in
honest comprehension, these two categories.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Then what is the
criterion?  We have said that if we are to<i> [keep]</i> our investigation in
the area which could have some significance, that is to say, could have some
applicability to real problems, then we are forced to find it in terms of
applicability, applicability being spoken of here as meaning successful
resolution of problematic situations.  And I should like to spend a few minutes
on the identification of successful revelation or clearer comprehension of the
criterion itself.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            I have presented the
position that problems can be categorized any number of ways, and that one
aspect of all problems--which you could use as a way of getting at what we have
heretofore spoken of as real problems and imaginary problems--is, in real
problems  the inclusion of factors other than those which are subject to
predilection.  And I’m not sure that all problems are not of that character. 
But I’m not sure that they are either.  At least we know there are problems of
that character.  ....</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            And when we say the
successful resolution of a problematic situation--the situation including items
other than and in addition to purposeful human behavior--then it necessarily
follows that, in such problems, resolution would include an adjustment of those
things which are within human discretion, because the solution of a problem
means human behavior, doing something about.  Many problems would disappear
with the disappearance of non-human factors that are not within human
discretion, but we do not speak of such instances as the resolution of the
problem.  More properly we would speak of it as the disappearance of the
problem.  ....</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            What we mean by the
resolution of a problem is purposeful human behavior.  You don’t solve problems
by accident.  But with the categories of value theory, both in the sense of
valuation and in the sense of value being arbitrarily determined, you can’t
resolve a problem except by the sheerest accident, that is to say, lacking
comprehensible relationship between items in sequence--that’s what we mean by
accident.  There is no correlation in terms of conscious comprehension. 
Example: disease.  <i>[Its resolution]</i> has to effectively correlate the
items in a particular sense--irrespective of predilection, of the mores and
folkways, or what have you.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            And it is that particular
sense that characterizes the character of value.  The nearest that we have come
to it in philosophical consideration, I think, is called instrumental
correlation, which has the distinguishing characteristic of inescapability. 
Not only the distinguishing characteristic of inescapability, but the
distinguishing characteristic of continuity in the sense of continuing
interminably, without termination.  And also a third attribute peculiar to it,
that the continuity is not situational.  Things that exist are not the same
things that exist later, but the character of the relationship continues to
exist.  Instrumental correlation.  And it is on that score that the situational
picture in getting at dynamic explanation, as we usually say it, is avoided. 
It is thereby that we have avoided the problems with taking cross sections in
examining process and getting them as close together as you can in the hopes of
explaining the cross section.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Getting cross sections
closer together is the same situation as the hare and the tortoise.  The hare
never catches the tortoise, you see, by simply setting up your analysis with
conceptual tools which give you intermittencies.  The old Greek  argument about
every time the hare moves as far as to where the tortoise was when he started
moving at any particular time, by that time the tortoise would have moved some
distance.  The hare is going twice as fast as the tortoise but he never catches
him, because ... you reduce the distance between them to an infinitely small
distance.  However small the distance, if it is positive at all, every time he
gets to where the tortoise was, the tortoise has moved so the hare never
catches him.  That’s the kind of situation this kind of theory gets you into. 
....</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            That isn’t the way the
social process operates.  That isn’t a process.  It has a use, but it doesn’t
constitute explanation.  ....  <i>[Comparing cross sections]</i> doesn’t
explain anything, of course.  But it might help you begin to locate the area in
which you might find explanation.  When you attain explanation, my point is, it
has to be in terms which do not postulate <i>[intermittencies]</i> if it is to
be continuous--which is a peculiarity of the instrumental concept of
continuity. <i> [Cross sections cannot be situational or occupy time; they must
be in terms of process to maintain continuity.]</i></p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Now note the confusion
that frequently has occurred in social analysis--and this is particularly true in
economics--trying to explain a process through getting these cross sections
close together--J.B. Clark.  The reason is that efforts to apply either of the
two categories of valuation or value theory leave nothing except this study and
a very close juxtaposition of whatever these things are<i> [that you measure. 
Like a motion picture].</i>  Thus you “see” motion, but you don’t explain
anything.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The confusion about
continuity that I would like to get rid of at the moment is the notion that
simply, first, anyone who has looked at the philosophical problems much--the
real, practical , fundamental problems involved--is sometimes thinking as John
Stuart Mill did, of continuity as meaning lasting a long time.  Then one of
these cross sections may be true or untrue, depending on how long it has
lasted--a situational pattern of human relationships, of institutions.  If it
has lasted a long time, <i>[it is assumed to prove it is more correct--more
instrumentally specified than ceremonially.]</i>  Not at all.  <i>[Lasting a
long time]</i> has nothing to do with continuity in the sense that I am trying
to identify it.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Stability is more nearly
the correct symbol for what they call continuity.  That a pattern lasts a long
time does not prove anything; long life doesn’t prove validity.  Long life is
not continuous with anything in the ceremonial sense.  And the relation between
the ceremonial specification and this non-applicable value theory in the two
general categories I indicated is pat, complete, and inescapable.  There is no
other way to get an an explanation of <i>[ceremonial patterns]</i> except
through non-evidentially determined criteria.  That is what makes it so easy
for the mores principle to take on the corollaries it has taken on, and to
creep into the very carefully thought  analysis so easily, even into our
thinking and behavior.  The only thing continuous about this process is that
... there is change, which we have known forever. <i>[They] </i>say the only
thing we know for certain about anything is that it changes; then they proceed
to say that it changed from here to here, as if they said something
significant.  But the significance is only in terms of description, not
explanation.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The factors must be set
up, if they are to attain continuity in the instrumental sense, as non-intermittent
in any sense, right on through.  And that has been our experience.  The actual
run of human experience has been non-intermittent fact.  You don’t experience,
and then not, and then experience and then not.  You experience, period!  All
the time.  That’s why, you see, you can’t escape the consequences of your own
behavior.  If you could do that, then you could wipe them out in between, but
you can’t do that.  The best thinkers on the matter have been getting at that
... for two or three thousand years: your sins will find you out, as it were. 
All the great religious thinkers have been getting at it; there is no
in-between space.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            So our problem is to get
value comprehended which permits continuity in that sense.  ....  Continuity
and process--some sense of process, never in terms of situation.  Situations
vary, we know, and looking at these cross sections has revealed that they
change and are different.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'><b>lecture twenty-two</b></p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Last time we noted that,
in order to attain continuity, the theory of value must be set up to be
processional and not situational.  It must be, so as to identify it in terms of
progress rather than in terms which are useful in identifying a certain
situation, because situations change.  The theory of social value has to be in
terms of the social process, and it has to be applicable to social problems
that arise in that process.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            And this is the point of
the distinction which is frequently made in relation to ultimates, with the
semantic difficulties<i> [of distinguishing ultimate in the sense of continuous
with the universe of application from ultimate in the sense of final cause]</i>. 
</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            In one sense of the word,
there are ultimates in the sense of continuing factors, continuous with the
universe of identification.  The specification of the universe is itself the
identification of such continuing factors.  If you can separately identify
anything, you have thereby come into comprehension of continuing factors,
things which distinguish it and thereby identify its limitations
chronologically and otherwise.  So, to say, “There can be no theory of this or
that” is to deny that “this or that” is a separate identifiable or conceivable
item. For example, to say that there can be no such thing as human nature is to
say necessarily that you can’t separately identify human beings from other
phenomena.  And of course you can.  So, there are necessarily ultimates in the
sense of continuous with the universe of application or identification.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The controversy, however,
is confused by imputing something of that sense to another sense of ultimates
which ..., so far as our experience is concerned, can’t exist.  And that is the
ultimate which you might characterize as final, in the sense of final causes. 
Now, in the first sense, there is a finality involved.  But that first sense
allows correction and situationally variable specification.  In the second
sense, <i>[the finality is something outside of our experience, outside of]</i>
the process we call the universe.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Everything we know about
human behavior occurs within the social process and has come from our
experience within that process.  Those are the facts which are to be explained
in social theory, and no one has ever presented one item of evidence that he
has had social experience outside of that process.  ....  No one has ever
presented any evidence of any kind that he has received comprehension of that
process other than by looking at that process.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            There are indeed many
claims to revelation about that process. Unfortunately, it seems to me, most of
these have been figures of speech which someone with considerable insight is
using to explain what he has observed in the social process, but which the
naive have taken literally to constitute the specification of that process.  I
repeat: no one has ever received, so far as we call tell, any evidence about
the social process from any other source than the social process.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            In that sense, then, there
can be no teleological determination of that process.  The locus--where you
look because of where they are--of the evidences about the criterion of
judgment, about alternatives arising in that social process, is within that
process.  It cannot be anywhere else.  It is inconceivable that it could be
anywhere else. <i> [But]</i> it is very easy to involve ourselves in the
assumption that value--the criterion of judgment--of necessity lies outside of
the process, that it cannot serve as the criterion of judgment unless it is
outside that process.  <i>[That assumption],</i> when it becomes available,
whatever its shape ... working down toward applicability to particular
problems, is some kind of teleology.  That’s what we mean by teleology: an
outside-of-the-process directional determinant or identification.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            I am willing to lay the
charge that most so-called instrumentalists are involved--particularly in the
more complicated areas of human experience such as aesthetics--in that
imputation.  Though stating and comprehending quite clearly what I shall here
call the instrumental theory of value, they nevertheless proceed to work with
the assumption that it isn’t a theory of value; that, in order to be a
criterion of judgment, it has to have its locus outside of that process.  And
the reason for that, I think, is not clearly understood, and I should like to
explain what seems to be the reason.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            In the operation we call
thinking, quite clearly you don’t get anywhere with a truism except an
exercise.  For example, to define a word you have to use other words than the
word you are defining.  A good dictionary never says a mouse is a mouse.  It
says what a mouse is with some other words.  The other words may simply be
saying mouse in several words instead of one, and in a sense that is what
should be done.  In a sense that is how we come to identify what a mouse
is--through several looks at the thing the symbol stands for.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            In that same sense,
independent identification of a universal criterion of judgment ... within the
process to which it is universally applicable, would seem to be necessarily
involved in saying that a mouse is a mouse.  It is antipathy toward that
previous position, which is simply a matter of not having thought through the
matter very well.  That little simple thing has permitted us to succeed in not
looking at the problem directly.  It is through that gate--and I have observed
people over and over again running in and out of that gate--that we have been
permitted with some semblance of self-respect to get involved in activities
which successfully camouflage the issue at hand.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            That is why I said to the
class this morning, if you want to save your face, talk about the words instead
of the problems.  Raise questions about the words.  Of course you won’t solve
the problem, but you will indeed save your face.  And of course here, we have
no faces to save; we shan’t consider them worthwhile in our present exercise.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            In the second sense, there
can be no outside-of-the-process locus of value.  ....  If value cannot be
located within the process, then it cannot be located.  There can be no such
thing really as value.  It would have to be a figment of the imagination.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>STUDENT: <i>“There seems to me to be a
paradox involved here.  Having said in the past that the social process is
constituted by a complex of institutions ...”</i></p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            No, I didn’t!  If I did, I
ought to be bumped on the head.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>STUDENT:<i> “All right, then of what

is constituted of interrelated activities of humans ... and, since the locus of
value is within the process, then value comes from the interrelated activities
of human beings?”</i></p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            We might quarrel a little
bit about the “comes from,” but I’ll go along with you.  That is correct, but
there is no paradox involved in it.  The institutional structure is that
through which the social process is carried on.  It is the specification--in
its least accurate form by Dr.<i> [Robert H.]</i> Montgomery--of the rules of
the game.  An institution is a prescribed pattern of correlated human behavior,
and no one has ever said it better than that that I know.  Why? Because you
can’t hold to a teleological construct and admit that is what institutions
are.  You can’t even admit that things we call institutions exist therein. 
Because they then become human inventions, and there are teleological recourses
involved.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            ....</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            I used the examples of
Maine’s <u>Ancient Law</u> and Darwin’s <u>Origin of Species</u>, in which the
very crux of the problem we are discussing was made so plain in Maine’s work
that to some modern scholars--I mean in the last twenty years--it hurts, it
slaps you in the face.  <i>[When published,]</i> it didn’t cause more than a
ripple, while Darwin's <u>Origin of Species</u>, though it wasn’t even
concerned with institutional affairs directly, caused a turmoil.  It was concerned
with genetics, of how it comes about that species were differentiated.  Yet it
raised quite a racket, did it not?  The situation in that illustration now is
exactly the opposite, because the evidences are sufficient that we can proceed
with confidence in the biological area up to and beyond the point that Darwin
acceded to.  The reason it then caused the racket--and even bloodshed--is
because then biology was still useful as a device for maintaining or attaining
a particular institutional structure. It has since been robbed of that
function, and now we can talk about it intelligently, I would say.  We can talk
about it without raising a racket.  We can inquire into it without fear.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            But try it in law.  Try it
in the law journals.  No one has had the courage or the understanding or
whatever it is to try it as yet.  But it is coming.  There have been hints of
it now for thirty or forty years, and every slightest hint of it in the law
journals has raised a racket.  Maine’s<u> Ancient Law</u> didn’t even prove the
case to him, so he didn’t know what he had done.  The data he
collected--magnificent inquiry--told something that the state of understanding
in the legal theory at the time did not permit him to conclude.  What he proved
is the mores principle in law, and law has always by its bare operations
evidenced an outside-of-the-social-process locus of the criterion of judgment. 
The law is the law!  Meaning that it has validity as such, not in reference to
the process of which it is a part, but in reference to something else making it
what it is, and you can’t question that something else.  The basic data then
become the law, and if that be true in regard to any institutional device,
including the law, then the whole of the examination of the utility theory of value,
and the whole of social science is pure, simple, palpable nonsense, other than
as entertainment value.  Then again, all you need to do is to decide what you
like, and that is that.  Then you don’t proceed in the way of science, you
proceed in the way of propaganda.  Since you know the answers, of what account
is analysis?  Since you know what the answer is to be or should be, then what
you need is to go directly to that answer.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            With the scientific
method, you discover ends, you bring into view further ends as you proceed.
There is no ultimate end ... because the ends you bring into view are
situational ends, and there is no “ultimate” situational end within human
experience.  <i>[But with an outside-of-the-process criterion]</i>, since you
have no experience with it and can’t use reason in analysis, you will have to
rely on something other than evidence.  And what else in ...  prescriptions of
correlated human behavior can be used to determine institutional structure? 
The one other thing: the use of force, and that is what we have been doing. 
What do you think war is?  What do you revolution is?  What do you think the
fighting is about?  It’s a use of force to install and maintain a particular
pattern, that is to say, the initiation of the use of force in an effort to
determine institutional structure.  There is no other use of force with which I
am acquainted, or with which I have ever heard of anyone else being
acquainted.  You can either use science or you can use force, and it is not
accidental that teleological analysis always includes the coercive enforcement
of the prescription.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'><b>lecture twenty-three</b></p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Last time we were
concerned with getting in view the value problem.  The character of the theory,
I think, is that it has to be in terms which permit direct identification of
the<i> [social]</i> process, and the locus of the criterion must lie within
that process if we are to know anything about it.  And if we are here to
consider something about which we know and can know precisely nothing, then it
seems to me that we are wasting our time.  Add to that the realization that we
do, in fact, act--necessarily and inescapably--within a criterion, through the
application of a criterion.  Then, of course, we are forced to the conclusion
that, since our behavior historically has not been simply random--a dance of
the atoms--, since there is continuity in some sense other than simple
chronology, then necessarily we have been applying a theory of value, and it is
located within that social process.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The sense of continuity
which we have been looking at ... is not of lasting a long time, and certainly
not lasting a long time situationally.  But it is in a very clear way
cumulatively developmental.  And in that attribute, C.E. Ayres finds the theory
of progress.  I illustrated it this way last time.  Suppose you start
somewhere, wherever you can pin together the evidences and run <i>[the
development of civilization]</i> over time this way.  ....  <i>[Each cross
section is different from the others]</i>, but is continuous with them in causal
terms in either direction ...</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Now there is the other
aspect of our experience which is non-causal in its explanation.  It is really
an explanation which isn’t an explanation; it is an effort to apply a theory
which is inapplicable to the real problems involved, and thus the restatement
of the problems as something other than what they really are.  And that has
found perfect humus--food and form--in efforts to apply the utility theory of
value, by virtue of what I said time before last, in the two categories of ways
of getting at predetermined answers: 1) through an a-prioristic identification
of the theory of value itself, allowing an infinite variety of specifications
at that level or of that criterion--and thus in the sense of rational
consistency specifying all the answers subsequent to it, since it in itself is
situational and its application does not give you direction; deviations from it
are bad and movements toward it are good--and 2) the category of a unified and
consistent and unchanging--a one-choice--theory of value with an infinite
number of theories of valuation.  This permits valuation analysis to attain the
same answers as in the first category, that is to say, the attainment of
answers which of themselves have been predetermined situationally.  ....</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            It is at this point that
trouble develops in the educational process of coming to understand, of pushing
that point <i>[of causal understanding]</i> out toward confrontation with the
problem. <i> [Our students]</i> ask us to tell them the answers the first day. 
You don’t do that; our character and nature don’t permit us that kind of
locomotion.  As Lewis H. Haney pointed out <i>[<u>History of Economic Thought</u>]</i>, 
we are all in that sense emburdened, equipped with an institutionally
determined set of tools and, insofar as we don’t have other tools and must
carry on the functions for which we use these tools, we use them--or try to.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            In that sense, in the
second category we have attained the same results with an almost astounding
elaboration of the refinement of the theory of valuation.  We have succeeded in
maintaining the age-old answers, which all along have the major content of
being disconnected from the problematic situations where they arise.  What has
resulted ... is  the mores principle and its many corollaries, one of which is
that the possibility of culture patterns is infinite.  You can find, in regard
to any particular function carried on by any particular institution in any
particular culture, other cultures which deviate from it in an opposite sense. 
You have polygamy and polyandry; in their generic relationship they are
opposite of monogamy.   You have capitalism, communism, fascism, feudalism,
etc. with all sorts of institutional structures.  There is no limit to the
possible variations, and those patterns coexist at any particular time and
follow each other over time in any particular physical community.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            For the moment, let’s look
at a particular community over time; then we will look at the difference here
of many communities over the same time.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            In a certain
community--say, Western Europe--you have certain divisions: Greek culture,
Roman civilization, feudalism, etc.  We say, “the fall of Roman civilization:”
something happened here that permits us to speak as if the Roman civilization
fell, and then there was feudalism after the falling.  Where we can’t be very
sure, we say “the Dark Ages,” indicating the absence of whatever it is that was
before and after.  Sometimes, the more naive of us speak of a “great
civilization,” and the pictures of it in modern paintings are much in our own
image except for the dress style: luxury, fountains, cool water, beautiful
maidens, buildings requiring a lot of labor, etc.  And right in there the Dark
Ages, which was neither capitalism nor European feudalism; the institutional
structures were different.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            But note that some
particular prescribed patterns of correlated behavior are the same.  ....  For
example here <i>[in capitalism]</i> the most nearly sacred institution is
private property, while here <i>[in feudalism]</i> it is the greatest sin.  In
a brief thousand years, private property had come to be the foundation stone of
civilization itself.  And if you don’t think they could say it then like they
say it now, go read Marcus Cato in the halls of the Roman Senate, and you will
find that--as he put it--and as the Chamber of Commerce and the Baptist Church
still do--, “The very columns upholding civilization are at stake gentlemen.” 
Therefore, ending every speech with “<i>Delenda est Carthago</i>,” “We have to
go kill a bunch of folks.  They’re getting to thinking they are as good as we
are.”  The pattern of the total structure is different, but many parts are
identical with previous theory.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Now, what fell with Rome? 
What was different?  Well, a power system fell.  And ever since Edward Gibbon,
the historians have been saying that over and over.  But they haven’t been
saying a “power system” fell as frequently as a “civilization” fell.  A
particular pattern of institutions was radically changed.  Many of the items
were used in the subsequent pattern, or were current at a subsequent stage. 
....  We say that with the disintegration of the Roman authority, the Dark Ages
came into existence, and the German communal villages which had preexisted,
which were coexistent with this but were very different in institutional
structure, developed into a feudal institutional structure.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            What happens when you
change civilization in this sense?  ....  Items like architecture might be very
different, the family structure might be less different.  But a major
difference is the theory of valuation.  The way we now analyze the development
of western culture--the articulate and erudite writing of the community--it is
the utility theory of value all the way through.  But there are all sorts of
different theories of valuation.  ....  These discontinuous changes come from
the shift in the <i>de facto</i> exercise of coercive authority.  All of you
are acquainted with events that occurred in that area: how the Roman military
machine went to pieces, in the sense that it became a bunch of gangsters on the
one hand, and a non-participating population on the other.  In Rome itself,
there came to be what historians generally speak of as the mob, that is to say,
the Roman people.  The Romans had learned to live by predation rather than
production, and they continued to do so for a long time.  Then, in an effort to
maintain that situation, there developed a whole galaxy of problems; we would
call it unemployment.  The Nazis called it the German army--a non-participating
group, the mob.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            And when the so-called
fall of Rome came in the fifth century, it wasn’t those barbarians coming in
and taking over Rome, was it? Who was it <i>[defeated]</i> Rome at the
so-called fall of Rome?  Wasn’t it <i>[a barbarian who, with his army]</i>, had
become Romans?  They were the local political machine, they ran the army, they
were professional fighters.  ....</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            It got to a point for a
lot of reasons, including the continuous raping of the provinces and
non-participation in Rome,<i> [that local leaders didn’t care who ruled in
Rome]</i>.  The local boys began to find ways to circumvent successfully the
powers sent against them, because they were trained in that machine.  .... 
They were peasant farmers who had become professional soldiers.  And they began
to think in terms of imposing their will on other persons, and the way to do
that is with the sword.  So they became rebels, not in the revolutionary sense
but in the political sense.  Out of that grew the manorial system.  The
latifundia became manors.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Now, note, you can’t
explain that in terms of capitalism.  You can’t validate their position by
conquest capitalistically.  ....  <i>[So they validated it as the will of God. 
The landlord became landlord by fighting for the land.]</i>  Feudal customs
grew out of his possession of armor and military skill and protecting the
voluntarily associated members of his community.  Agreements became laws by
feudal custom, and were enforced by the Church.  If it had pleased God to call
the landlord into that situation--especially in the second generation--then
what can you ask further than that?  ....</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The point is this: the
theory of value and/or valuation during Roman times was different than and
non-continuous with the theory of value and/or valuation in feudal times.  And
the institutional structure was discontinuous.  The total feudal structure was
replacemental of, not developmental of, the total Roman structure.  ....  The
transition of actual power always results in the use of whatever is available
for maintaining the new pattern of power--institutional devices and whatever
you can invent; it always requires new inventions.  So the structure rapidly
becomes very different in its particulars and in its totality.  And the
difference in the totality is the result of the change in the theory of value
and/or valuation <i>[that accompanies]</i> the attainment and maintenance of
power, coercive authority, enforcing one’s discretion over the behavior of
other persons.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            And that is what, I am
afraid, the historians have been calling civilization.  They lament the Dark
Ages.  They indicate that something was light before<i> [the fall of Rome and
dark after.] </i> But people ate as much--indeed, they ate much more--after
than before.  They wore more clothing, they lived in better houses, more of
them could read and write, they were acquainted with a larger part of the
world, they had more leisure time, they associated more nearly amiably with
each other, there was much less bloodshed, they had less disease.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            What fell wasn’t these
accomplishments.  The instrumentalities of human experience were more and more
provided.  Architecture didn’t go backward, nor did glassmaking nor
shipbuilding, etc.  These items were continuous.  They plowed land after just
like they did before, except better.  Their plows were better.  They didn’t
build roads, not because they couldn’t but because the military use of those
roads had disappeared.  The police power was exercised locally, not a thousand
miles away; not from Rome but from the guy on the hill in the big manor house.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Now note that the theory
of value and valuation in technology is exactly the same after as before.  It
is continuous.  While we can characterize the institutions as replacemental,
the technology is continuous--the continuous recombination of accomplished
knowledge and understanding, and its extension into hypothetical situations in
the future.  Invention was the same thing after as before.  Things were
invented for the ends in view, and though it be true that “invention is the
mother of necessity,” it is also true that “necessity is the father of
invention.”</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Incidentally, Veblen’s
quip that invention is the mother of necessity seems to me to be a good example
of what blocked his accomplishment of the theory of institutions.  He <i>[couldn’t]</i>
grant the rationality of human behavior even where its rationality is in fact
determined.  It is “incontinent habituation.”  Somebody sort of invents
something, that is sort of an accident, and then you become sort of habituated
to it, and thus it becomes a necessity.  That is true: you like what you have
learned to like.  ....</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Now note that no matter
what, the power transfer results in a change in its rationalization because of
the change in its power pattern.  In Germany, from the capitalistically useful
theory of valuation--the price theory--they shifted in a very brief time to
Nazism, to authoritarian rule with a personal dictator determining what is
right and wrong.  No continuity in this sense.  It is replacemental and,
therefore, not true.  It isn’t in conformity with the facts.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            And what are those facts? 
The continuing factors are the locus of value, if continuity means anything
other than lasting a long time.  Continuity is the locus of validity and the
content of civilization.  The Greeks had a superior civilization.  They knew
the arts and the sciences, and they knew how to apply them to the problems of
their life.  But when we say that civilization fell when Rome fell, what fell? 
Not civilization.  Not the arts and sciences, but power.  There has never been
a lost art, with very minor exceptions.  ....</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'><b>lecture twenty-four</b></p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>STUDENT: <i>“There is something which
bothers me about the non-developmental character of [institutional change].  I
get sort of an inevitable idea out of the supposition that power begets power. 
Power systems once established aren’t modified, they are replaced.  And yet you
are connoting that once a person attains to power he thereby continues to seek
ego satisfaction by virtue of [the continuity] of that problem.”</i></p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            I’m glad you asked that
question, because it occurred to me last time after class that that might have
been heard out of what I said ...</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            That isn’t the case.  We
said something like this.  The two kinds of validification and explanation <i>[are
the instrumental</i>-<i>-within-the -process and, therefore, continuous--and
the utilitarian--outside-of-the-process and, therefore, discontinuous].</i> 
Things that are invented <i>[in the  arts and sciences] </i>are capable of
instrumental correlation with other items in the general social structure,
which are carried on through <i>[institutions]</i> but under a different theory
of valuation.  The theory of valuation other than the instrumental theory of
value comes after a pattern is sufficiently widely established to permit
habitual behavior and defense and attack.  <i>[The non-instrumental theory] </i>is
not and never is the deliberate application in the invention sense.  It becomes
the common sense and then is articulated, as is always the case with
nonscientific theory, and is sometimes the case with scientific theory. The difference
is not discernible by virtue of its tardy articulation, tardy to application. 
The difference is such that scientific theory can and frequently does precede
the actual application, whereas nonscientific theory cannot be and never has
been functional in that sense.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Thus you will find that,
in every field of inquiry which is separately identifiable for purposes of
analysis, up to the point of the shift to the scientific theory of valuation
and value, that accomplishments become established irrespective of, always
contra to, the theory of valuation being used.  At that point of shift,
however, the situation in that regard is exactly reversed.  This is the
relationship between alchemy and chemistry; between social studies and social
science.  We are now right there.  Up to that point, alchemists learned a very
great deal about science.  They learned it in spite of the theory of valuation
and the theory of value, not through applying them; not even through efforts to
apply them.  They learned it through manipulating the items with which they
worked.  The Aristotelian logic which the feudalists tried to apply to the
problems of biology of their day resulted in no advance.  Example of monks and
the number of teeth in a horse’s mouth.  What they concluded through trying to
apply Aristotelian logic in no sense added anything to science. They learned
not through efforts at application, but in spite of them.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Counting things is a
scientific procedure as such.  It requires setting up a taxonomy of some sort
in order to know which things to count.  It requires classification and
identification.  And in looking at these things and counting them, they were
not applying Aristotelian logic at all.  In the absurd illustration above,
there was no need to observe the facts, and they got the wrong answers.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The theories of physical
relationships<i> [are discontinuous]</i> up to the point of deliberate
application of instrumental value criteria.  From that point on, never again do
you have to start counting the teeth in horses’ mouths.  You know the theory of
genetics, you don’t have to count the teeth of every horse that comes into your
pasture.  Up to the point of deliberate shift from explanation in terms other
than instrumental verification, theories are replacemental.  They are neither
applicable nor cumulatively developmental.  From that point, theory always
proceeds <i>[developmentally]</i>.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Pre-Copernican
astronomical theory was useful in invidious differentiation, and caused
bloodshed when someone watched the sun. We got telescopes, astrolabes, and lots
of things, and the evidence piled up to such a point that the general
principles became apparent and were stated.  Up to that point, we discovered
our stars and planets by searching the heavens.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            How do we discover a
stellar body today?  First, we discover where it is, what its mass and velocity
and orbit are, and where it ought to be at a particular time.  Then we look at
that area until we find it.  Almost every discovery of stellar bodies in recent
years has been that kind of operation.  Why?  Because we have scientific theory
applicable to finding stellar bodies.  ....  How could you do that with
pre-Copernican theory?  You couldn’t.  You found them, and then you said
something about them in conformity with the criterion of judgment used in that
area.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Experience precedes
pre-scientific theory, always and necessarily so.  Science, therefore, is
capable of prediction, and the test of its completion, of whether or not it is
science, is its predictable capacities.  If you can’t predict with it, it
either isn’t science or it is too immature to handle the problem at hand. 
Pre-scientific theory in every area of inquiry means, of necessity and
inescapably, that its application can’t predict anything.  But note, from the
very earliest social order about which we know anything, persons carry on the
social process through institutions and perform what I refer to as the
instrumental functions of institutions.  There is science involved.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Now the prevailing theory
of valuation is still largely nonscientific.  We are still arguing about
whether human behavior is subject to rational analysis.  And I have tried to
illustrate for you the impact that scientific method has had on social
analysis, and how we strain to maintain the old answers while admitting
science. <i> [Throughout human history]</i> instrumental functions have been
carried on, and by virtue of the character of the case they cannot be carried
on under any other kind of comprehension than the instrumental criterion.  And
that makes our practice advance a little, because people keep counting teeth. 
Nevertheless, the articulate and accepted theory in social analysis has always
been utility.  Lack of applicable theory explains the sterility of social
analysis throughout history.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Economics became known
very early as “the dismal science,” and, of course, it is far and away the
maturest of the social sciences--in the sense of elaborately developed theory. 
Economists keep counting things, but they can’t get answers, or predict
anything, or solve problems.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The father of modern
economic science, William Petty, went out and counted things.  Then he set up
judgments--<u>Political Arithmetick</u>, he called his book--trying
deliberately to get science into the analysis.  But he confused science; he
associated it with things you can count.  He knew things in a sense different
than the scholastics knew.  ....   Francis Bacon was pleading for science in
physical analysis, in biology; and Pasteur was pleading for a shift in the
theory of valuation.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            And note that, once the
shift is attained, never again is it subject to use for invidious purposes. 
Before the shift, solutions were attained irrespective of theory, and
frequently in spite of it.  That helps explain why many institutions are quite
clearly non-instrumental in their function.  They have been peculiarly amenable
to these general theories of valuation, useful for invidious differentiation,
whether useful instrumentally or not.  But the instrumentality keeps getting
bigger and better.  ....</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Europeans frequently speak
of Americans as vulgar because we talk so much about the tallest buildings and
the biggest ranches, etc.  Well, we are vulgar in a sense.  But there is more
than an accidental connection of validity in that “vulgar” talk.  More and
better of the means of life is the real validity involved in that kind of
assertion.  And you will find peoples who have not found any way to work out
their major  problems, rationalizing their own ineptitude, their own “less and
poorer” by calling it <i>[culture]</i>.   Frenchmen today call Americans
vulgar, saying they “don’t know how to live.”  Phooey!  They may know how to
live, but it is not because they don’t have the means of life.  ..  They talk
about the noble existence of the peasant.  Of course, the bedbugs eat him up at
night, his food gives him the colic, he is illiterate, vulgar and obscene, and
dies by the time he is fifty.  You may have ample means of life and still be
vulgar, but it isn’t because you have the means of life that you don’t know how
to live.  ....</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            At the point where a
community takes a deliberate decision to investigate its social affairs
scientifically--in terms of its instrumental function, just like the physical
sciences--from that point on the relationship between theory and practice, as
it were, reverses itself.  From that point on, the general theory constantly is
applied and is applicable, depending on the accuracy and maturity of the
theory, not on the character of the operations.  From that point on, it
flowers.  ....</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Our knowledge of man--from
the dawn of written history to now--occupies just the last two minutes of a
twelve hour clock tracing the world’s history.  Only minutes ago he learned to
apply the instrumental theory of communication.  When he reached that point, he
started to solve problems very rapidly.  ....  Just now we are beginning to
struggle with social theory in those terms.  We have been fooling around with
it in the shadows, but deliberately for a couple of hundred years.  In the Age
of Reason, we decided to do it that way.  We didn’t know enough psychology and
anthropology to understand the character of  our basic data.  Now we do, and
the challenge <i>[to culture]</i> is being made.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Count the automobiles in
America today, and look at the auto production capacity.  You find no
synonymy.  No matter what the firms and the price theory of valuation say, we
know we can make more cars than we are making.  The<i> [Second World War] </i>demonstrated
it to us, as the First World War did.  But we still say, “Supply and demand
will work it out to the maximum.”  We know that the market does not solve it. 
And in America, we have known it for 150 years, and since Veblen we have had
the courage to say so.  ....  Now we are demanding that war and unemployment be
whipped.  We are demanding to have the experiences which the arts and sciences
make possible, and we will not take no for an answer because we can already see
the criterion of judgment.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            And, incidentally, the
articulate realizations come out of America by virtue of that peculiarly
fortunate <i>[frontier]</i> experience through which the American people went. 
It is struggling out through philosophy and the social sciences, and is now
ready for articulation. It has been a rough go, has it not?  The whole world
has condemned that kind of thinking because it does violence to all their <i>[traditions]</i>. 
</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            All “isms” are equally
nonsensical, in the sense that they are non-significant, non applicable.  .... 
Scientific knowledge gives you that particular advantage of the possibility of <i>[application
to and understanding of]</i> the basic continuing factors in human experience. 
It gives you the possibility of sophistication.  ....</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The scientific concept of
value is seen to be in terms of process, since the whole of our experience has
been with process.  To be a true concept--to be in conjugate correspondence
with its referent--it must display the attribute we call continuity. 
Therefore, to be a valid concept, we must bring our ideas into correspondence
with the evidential facts of the process--the only uniformly identifiable
continuum in our whole social experience, the causally determined sequence of
events we call the social process.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            So it is in that process
itself that we can correctly identify the locus of value.  In your reading of
C.E. Ayres, you will note that it is to this point that he carries his search
for the same thing we are in quest of here.  But we will have to go beyond
that.  Identifying the locus, or where it is, does not identify its character. 
The locus, the social process, may be gauged in two ways: 1) direction and 2)
condition.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            In regard to direction, we
have seen that this concept may be and is used in the sense that judgments may
be and are made with reference to whether the process is towards--i.e.,
directional--or away from, a particular pattern of invidious differentiation,
that is to say, a particular institutional structure within which the process
is carried on.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            But in this instance, the
structure must find its validity outside and irrespective of the process; and
to attain such a separate identification, the structure must in fact be
independently determinate of the remainder of the process.  On this score, all
the evidence proves, I think, that the character of the process and the
institutions are not independent but, in fact, related; two faces of the same
process.  And not only is direction so identified invalid, in that the referent
for direction cannot be established in fact, but the criterion of judgment is
devoid of truth, in that the referent for the idea is in fact discontinuous:
the institutional structure itself and the constantly changing social process. 
So we must disregard, or at least lay aside as untrue, the direction concept as
we have identified it here as a criterion of judgment.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The other way to gauge the
social process--the condition--we may use to identify how efficiently the
process is carried on or is proceeding.  But, here again, the referent we seek
is not yet specifically identified, for condition also can be conceived in two
ways: </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            1) As a degree of efficiency
in maintaining or attaining a particular pattern of invidious
differentiation--a particular institutional structure--and this criterion can
be applied to the whole or any part of the process.  But this concept of the
criterion of judgment displays all the difficulties of the direction concept;
it is, in fact, fundamentally the same concept, and those difficulties are
fatal.  Hence, efficiency itself does not end our quest for a direct
identification of value.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            2) As a non-invidious or
instrumental judgment that can be applied to any part or the whole of the
social process: how efficiently the non-invidious functions of the process are
being carried on.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Immediately you will
remember that that is the very aspect of the social process which we have identified
as the continuum, which does not change in character, only in degree or
magnitude.  And you will remember also that it is this form that is continuous,
and necessarily so; but you will also note that it differs from the other
concept of how the condition or the efficiency concept can turn.  It differs
from the other not in its universality or possibility of application in the
universe, but in the fact that it is continuous in the sense that its referent
maintains its same character.  And, of course, in the non-differing aspect it
too can be applied to any degree of any art at any time, but it can do so
without changing the character of that with which it purports to be in
conjugate correspondence.  It has real and uninterrupted continuity; its referent
is continuous with all the evidence, it is continuous causally with all that is
concurrent with it, and what can possibly be conceived as succeeding over time
is conceived only as causally continuous with it.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Hence, in fact, we must
say that this concept has continuity and applicability throughout the universe
of its identification.  We must conclude that this concept of the criterion of
judgment of social value satisfies all the requisites of truth: it is true not
only by virtue of the impossibility of anything else fulfilling those
conditions, but also by virtue of the positive identification of that
fulfillment.  Hence, whether your proof runs to the matter of exclusion or
independently of that, you are forced into accepting the same referent into the
identification of value as instrumental efficiency. It is that simple.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            On that positive side,
looking at the run of the facts drives us into that position.  Fundamental
social value cannot be anything other than instrumental efficiency, because
with anything else, the very process being judged ceases to be, and all value
in it ceases to be. Continuity becomes a meaningless sound, and truth becomes a
lie.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            ....</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The area of discretion in
social problems is limited to institutional structures; answers to problems
take the form of institutional adjustments, making choices of how to correlate
human behavior.  The given data include the theory of human nature--individual
psychology--and non-human factors--physical facts.  Facts display no
contradictions or discontinuities in causal terms; only ideas display
discontinuity.  Institutional adjustment means choosing another way of
correlating behavior from that displayed in the problematic situation;
otherwise the problem remains.  Choosing is done by application of a criterion
of choice.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Scientific analysis cannot
proceed without resolution of the value problem.  Social analysis requires
identification of inclusive and continuing factors in the social process, and
having in view hypotheses about purposeful behavior.  Any analysis which
assumes all of the existing institutional structure is without significance.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'><b>lecture twenty-five</b></p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            .... And so this concept
of value--the criterion of judgment--satisfies all of the requisites of truth. 
Value is the kind of efficiency which I refer to as instrumental.  It can be
shown quite definitely without exception that at the attainment of<i>
[instrumental understanding] </i>in any area of investigation, any area of
problems envisioned by human beings, from that point on that part of the
content of human experience has flowered in an astounding fashion.  It was that
about which Madame Curie was speaking when she laid out her prayer for the
human species in terms of science.  It was that about which Thomas Jefferson
spoke.  ....  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            So the cold hard facts are
not so unpalatable; they are rather glorious things, facts.  But that is one
fact which has been difficult for us to get out hands on.  The difficulty is
not complexity in the ordinary sense of requiring much practice; the difficulty
as always lies in the dislocation occasioned to preconceptions of things we
hold dear.  ....  We have been cruel because we have been ignorant, and many of
our truths appear as lies and many of the lies we live appear as truths because
of the structural concept of the criterion of judgment.  Since there is no
escape from the cold hard fact of the <i>[instrumental]</i> criterion of
judgment, in          that the incidences of problems remain until that
criterion is used, and since we have solved many social problems, it therefore
necessarily follows--and is historically revealed--that that is the criterion
of judgment we have used, though we have tried to use many others.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>STUDENT:  <i>[When you have a number
of alternatives, how can you tell which is more or less efficient?]</i></p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            ....  That question arises
out of a number of things.<i> [It comes]</i> out of the whole development of
the analysis of the scientific method which has been circulating in the
community since the 1870s and in some degree prior to that time.  You find its
essential structure in <i>[Francis] </i>Bacon’s<i> [<u>Advancement of Learning</u>,
1605]</i>.  What it does is identify science with counting.  And, of course,
Bacon was not that naive and meant “more” or “less” which is correctly
conceived.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            You have to have a concept
of more or less which, in a sense, is going behind value.  The form it has
taken in social analysis--and particularly in economic analysis--is the theory
of valuation.  The way it has been associated with counting has been the notion
that if an<i> [item] </i>is subject to mathematical handling, then it is
subject to scientific method, and if not, not; or that numerical identification
permits accuracy, whereas other kinds of identification do not; or if you can
conceive something to be more than, or more like in any sense, it is therefore
subject to mathematical comparison.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The form it has taken in
the economic literature is through the utility theory of value and into the
price theory of valuation, in which you get a way of numerically identifying
something which itself is not subject to numerical identification directly. 
Thus the significance of price theory beyond business administration price
accounting.  That is to say its economic significance, without which it would
have no significance at all.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The next step in the
prevalent discussions of the scientific method immediately involved the
assumption that, for comparison of an attribute in one thing as compared with
the same attribute in another thing--value, for example--, you necessarily
require a unit of measurement; not necessarily numerically identifiable, in the
more advanced discussions, but at least comparable in some quantitative sense. 
Then the real assumption that that unit, or that “moreness or lessness,” is at
least subject to common statement, common caption, common attributes.  And that
assumption is the error.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            In science, there is no
common unit of measurement for efficiency in continua comprised of different
items, events, and/or objects.  And especially in continua which have no common
immediate functions.  Example: compare the efficiency of a telescope with a
combustible engine.  There is no unit of measurement for the telescope.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            All things have the
attribute of value, and thus are subject to comparison in value terms.  How do
you know, then, if one is more or less than the other?  Every problem specifies
the units of measurement.  The facts of the problem specify the theory of
valuation applicable to it.  It is from those facts, and reference to
relationships of those facts, that that unit becomes available or not
available.  Its availability--either actually or possibly--has nothing to do
with the validity of the criterion.  The criterion of judgment stands on quite
other grounds, irrespective of the particular items which specify the particular
valuation operation.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            ....  It is quite a
legitimate question for a community to ask, “Do we need a telescope more than
we need a hydroelectric plant?”  How do you form an answer to that?  There is
no unit of measurement.  It is a function of the facts which comprise the
problem.  There are a great many units for which we have no measurement:
beauty, roundness, straightness.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>STUDENT:<i> “How do you apply “the”
theory of value to music?”</i></p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Thank you.  I wish I had
thought of that.  It is the best example of what I was trying to say.  We don’t
have a unit of measurement, any more than we do for roundness.  Music is an
example of the application of aesthetic theory which is peculiar in the sense
that it is separate from all other applications in a very clear-cut and
understandable way.  Most of the fine arts--which are applications of the
theory of aesthetics--have common attributes in sufficient number that you can
sort of compare them.  But you can’t compare music to anything but music. 
There is some sound/rhythm aspect of music in verse; a little.  What does music
tell you about?  Poetry has other attributes than sound; it tells you
something.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            There is no unit of
measurement of social value.  But we have to make judgments on it.  There are
times when, individually and as groups, we have to make judgments as to whether
we require more music or more telescopes.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'><b>lecture thirty</b></p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Our last discussion was
concerned with the principle of recognized interdependence. I tried to point
out what seem to me to be some of the difficulties and confusions in
understanding that principle.  ....</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Developments in technology
bring about problematic situations in the institutional sphere in the social
sense.  Such developments cause what are frequently referred to as “changing
conditions.”  It is a different world than it was twenty years ago.  The
technologies have changed, noticeably, and they have brought about conditions
which we call social problems.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Not only is technology
determinate of social problems, in the sense that it creates such problems. It
also is determinate of the solutions to such problems, in the sense that it
constitutes the basic data which must be taken as given in social problems. 
Note that I do not say that technological factors determine the structure of
institutions in their instrumental aspects or their ceremonial aspects.  They
determine the problems.  Technology has been subject to the instrumental theory
of value in a fashion which has permitted it to be expanded and developed in an
amazing way in the last 100 years, at the same time as social analysis has been
subject to efforts to apply non-instrumental criteria.  ....</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            ....</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The most significant word
in the second principle is “recognized.”  The thing that most often confuses us
at this point is that scholars seem to think that adjustments can be made
completely outside of and irrespective of the recognized interdependencies. 
For example, most student presume that if a group is forced through coercive
power to behave in their interrelationships in ways contrary to what they
recognize ought to be, that that in some sense does violence to this
principle.  No, it does not. <i> [Coerced behavior]</i> does not bring into
consideration the determination of how that recognition may be brought about,
which involves the ceremonial-instrumental distinction applied to this item. 
The simple fact is that you literally can’t correlate your behavior in a
fashion which you do not understand.  It need not mean that you approve it,
although most frequently a majority of persons in any community approve the
established order.  We like what we have learned to like.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            And that has no
correlation whatever, Marx to the contrary notwithstanding, to its incidences
upon the persons whose opinions are in question.  I suggest, for example, that
the most conservative element in American society today is the organized labor
group.  They are most reluctant to envision any change in the more nearly
fundamental structure of our community.  Their almost sole effort as a group is
to try to use it for their particular benefit, as compared to other members of
the community, in the same way that any other business trading group envisions
that same process.  Yet I think almost all members of that group would agree
that labor is not peculiarly advantaged in our structure, that if anyone gets
the raw end of the deal, it is labor.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            So I repeat that it is not
true that there is any correlation between the support of a particular pattern
of institutions and the advantages gained therefrom.  The American Civil War is
another example that those who are least advantaged most vehemently support the
system under which they are least advantaged.  The war was fought by the poor
whites of the South; and if anyone ever got a raw deal in history, it was the
poor whites in the South.  So is the Spanish-American War.  It was pretty much
a commercial enterprise--witness the fact that the President of the United
States had in his pocket complete acquiescence to all our demands when he went
before Congress to ask for a declaration of war.  It was not those demands that
we were after.  Yet the business community was not notable for its sacrifices
in that endeavor.  The men who rode up San Juan Hill were not big businessmen. 
They were the Rough Riders, the Teddy Roosevelt type of people--the boys who
rode the range and drove the railroad spikes.  They were the type that made
Roosevelt president when they began to suspect the war’s commercial character. 
They were the guys who first supported the war most vehemently, not those who
were peculiarly advantaged by it.  My point is that there is no correlation
whatever between real economic interests and active conscious support of
particular institutional patterns.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            As I tried to make clear
in our discussion of the principle of technological determination, what
determines the pattern of active behavior in correlated fashion may come from
either of two sources: understanding or coercion.  It comes from both.  In so
far as behavior is invidious in character, it can come from no other source
than coercion.  There is no instrumental explanation of invidious
differentiation.  What Thomas Jefferson said in his most famous dictum is
literally true: all men <u>are</u> created equal.  And, for that matter, all
men die equal.  The only way you can enforce invidious behavior is through
coercion.  If you can’t explain it, what else can you do?</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            And that is why no
community can long tolerate the absence of theory, applicable in the sense of
explanation of its institutional structure.  Lacking explanation is the same
thing as saying there is no validity in it.  As long as people have the
capacity to reason, validity is inseparable from purposeful behavior.  You have
to validate your behavior individually and as a community.  You have to explain
or recognize that you have no reason, that you are not really human.  And we
know better than that.  Even with the ultimate of coercive power, you still
can’t make people correlate their behavior in a fashion unless they understand
that fashion.  You can’t play football unless you understand the rules; whether
you think they are good or bad, you have to understand them. <i> [The
Bolsheviks tried to enforce]</i> communism on the Russian peasant right off the
bat.  And he didn’t understand and they didn’t get any production.  He didn’t
know how.  And that is always the fatal danger in trying to impose an
institutional structure on anybody as the only way to carry on a particular
function. </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            It is in that sense that
the principle of recognized interdependence is literally, universally, and
uniformly true.  It still is true that you can correlate behavior on quite
other grounds than coercive authority.  And the question of coercion never
enters in the other kind of correlation.  Coercion doesn’t make sense, unless
somebody goes crazy.  The only legitimate use of police power in the
instrumental sense is protection against irrational behavior.  In the
ceremonial sense, of course, you can’t do without police power in quite another
sense.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            So it is that the
immediate specification is a pattern of recognized interdependence, which may
be brought about either by understanding or coercion or any mixture of the
two.  They frequently conflict.  The preferences of those in the possession of
coercive power-- (and it seems to me that the most pervasive and the most
persuasive coercion can be exercised through control of the economic process;
it takes the least manpower that way--you don’t even have to have an army, just
cut off their income, or make receiving income a matter of conforming to
certain patterns of correlated behavior)--those who really determine policy,
may differ from the understanding.  ....  What happens when those two come into
conflict?  A great many things.  So long as the non-choice determinants of the
problem exist, the human incidences of the problem remain and the prompting
toward resolution remains.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            There is no escape--by
whatever application of whatever power--from the human incidences of problems. 
Especially economic ones.  It just happens that we can endure loneliness or
anger or any other illth longer than we can abstain from eating.  That is why
the economic aspects of our problems are most frequently in focus.   People can
go along for generations not belonging, being lonely.  What they do in that case,
of course, is create patterns within which they can belong.  If the prevailing
structure doesn’t provide it, it comes underground and grows up.  They develop
institutions of their own.  The unemployed do it.  There is no escape from the
continuing incidences, and thus you will find sooner or later successful
protrusions creeping into the pattern which theretofore was completely
ceremonial, thus breaking it up.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            There is a compulsion
toward progress, and I suggest that the whole of human history bears out that
thesis, and thus fundamentally, optimism is the correct position.  It is in
fact true that you can’t live anyway without being optimistic.  You can’t
survive without it.  And that is when they accuse you or me of being a
“dreamer”--when we’re being optimistic.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            If you are a student of
social science, and thus your attention is constantly brought to focus upon the
problematic aspects of the social process, it is very easy to get pessimistic
about the deal.  All those problems--and they are there.  But human progress is
contained in their resolution.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'><u>Normative-positive distinction</u></p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'><u>            </u>Current social
science inquiry is emburdened with this distinction.  There is a tremendous
fear of going beyond it.  When it disappears, there will be no way of
validating a particular institutional structure. <i> [Accepting this
distinction means that]</i> social inquiry must be positivistic to become
scientific.  Normative judgments are thought to rest on the notion that value
is unknown and unknowable.  That position is invalid on grounds that all
behavior, other than habitual or random, involves a comprehension of an effort
to apply a theory of value.  It is in fact necessary to apply a criterion of
judgment. </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            All forms or varieties of the
normative-positive distinction <i>[assume]</i> a fixed missing middle:</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            a) Lord Robbins:
“Positive” is that which is observable in a descriptive sense, </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            characteristically
identifiable and non-evaluational; “normative” is evaluation,</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            judgmental, an operation
of the mind.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            b) Theory of knowledge:
“Positive”  is “what goes on here,” known in a different </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            way than the “normative,”
which is concerned with “what ought to go on here.”</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            c)  Philip Blair Rice:
“Positive” refers to phenomena that are factual or evidential,</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            although agreement on
evidences may differ in comparative estimations.  “Normative”</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            refers to the privacy of
direct observations.  He distinguishes between the public and</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            private character of
direct observations.  “Normative” refers to, or is grounded in,</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            subjective knowing,
personal feelings as evidences.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            A common attribute to all
sets of distinctions is the supposition that any real difference is a
difference in causal determination or evidential determination.  Positive is
causal, normative non-causal.  Example: economics perceived as a positive
science tells you how to get to where you want to go.  Consideration of where
you want to go is a non-economic inquiry.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'><u>Positive identification of theory
of value</u></p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Social analysis, if it is
to be more than a catalogue of descriptions, must involve the effort to apply a
criterion of judgment.  It is not concerned with what we would like to have as
a criterion of judgment, but rather with what in fact is an applicable theory
of value.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Since all purposeful
behavior is initiated by a choice from among alternatives, ... the “what is” is
a consequence of what someone thought ought to be prior to its initiation. 
Hence, it involves the application of<u> the</u> theory of value.  “What is”
came to be by virtue of a deliberate choice, preference, exercise of reason,
application of a theory of value.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Compulsions exist in
alternative-choosing situations.  To see or recognize an alternative <i>[requires
recourse to value theory].</i>  A common attribute of alternatives is that they
seem to offer problem-solving functions.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Personal interests and
social interests are different only under the utility theory of value:  one
member of the community is thought to be able to gain at the expense of the
community.  Instrumentally, there is no difference between individual and
social interests.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            In order to attain
continuity, the theory of value must not be situational, but rather
processional.  It must be in terms of social process.  Since there is <u>no </u>evidence
of experience outside the social process, the locus of value must necessarily
reside within it.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Teleology--outside-of-process
directionally determined--is claimed by other theories.  It is resorted to in
order to avoid violating predilections for answers already obtained.  Example:
Sir Henry Maine showed that law is teleological, with outside-the-process
warrantability.  It always includes coercive violence as an instrument of
institutional structure specified by teleology.  Two ways to get predetermined
answers are 1) a priori theories of value, the criteria themselves being
situational; 2) a unified theory of value, with an infinite number of theories
of valuation.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Since most behavior is not
random, and shows continuity other than chronologically, humans necessarily
have been applying a theory of value.  Ayres’s <u>Theory of Economic Progress </u>showed
that continuity should be perceived <i>[scientifically]</i> not in the sense of
lasting a long time, but as cumulatively developmental, continuous in causal
terms.  Other aspects of human experience are non-causal in character.  In the
technological continuum, the theory of value is continuous throughout; the
locus of validity is in technological connectedness.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            There is an infinite
variety of institutional patterns over time.  There is a replacement of power
systems, not of civilizations.  In a sense these replacements are not causally
connected; they are discontinuous.  But instrumental content is identifiable in
causal terms in successions of power systems, because such systems carry on instrumental
functions at some level of efficiency.  The perception of both instrumental and
ceremonial functions of institutions permits escape from the seeming paradox
between technological and institutional continua.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The causal potency of
institutional behavior carrying on instrumental functions is in the validity of
the idea, its correctness.  The causal potency of institutional behavior
carrying on ceremonial functions is in the application of coercive force.  Such
force has an instrumental function, i.e., to determine who shall have the next
opportunity to make choices rationally.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'><u>The Theory of Institutional
Adjustment</u></p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Principles are inclusive
and continuous factors of the social process; they permit of no exceptions in
application.  Situational elements, such as cross-section views of the process,
are not continuous.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'><u>The Principle of Technological
Determination</u></p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Accomplished facts
exterior to the area of human discretion specify the character of problems and
the areas of discretion.  The caption “technological” has come to connote not
only mechanical-engineering aspects, but all physical aspects.  With Ayres, it
is still more inclusive.  Its central referential content is the things we
think of as human contrivances, physical in character.  This aspect is the
aggressor in bringing on  problems.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Institutional invention is
not dependent upon technological invention.  Since the instrumental functions
of institutions are processional in character, institutional invention is
cumulative also; it depends upon things in combination.  Most inventions are
rearrangements of existing parts; some, however, create new items or parts.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Cultural lag is an
erroneous concept.  It assumes that the structures of institutions are
determined by the character of technology.  Structures of technology are
determined in the same way as structures of institutions.  Both technology and
institutions are capable of being used instrumentally or ceremonially; both
display the same process of invention; and the validity of both is determined
in the same way.  They are interrelated, but neither determines the other. 
....</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'><u>The Principle of Recognized
Interdependence</u></p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The immediate
determination of institutional structure is a deliberate decision, constituted
by effective agreement as to correlated patterns of behavior among those whose
behavior is to be correlated by the structure.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Revolutions fail because
they try to stop the social process and start over.  All adjustments which are
made must be capable of being instrumentally incorporated into the existing
institutional structure, so as not to contravene the instrumental functions of
those institutions involved which are not considered problematic.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'><u>The Principle of Minimal
Dislocation</u></p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Institutional adjustments
are limited to areas which satisfy the requirements of successful
incorporation.  This principle specifies which adjustments are available.  It
does not specify which ones to choose.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            A community is restricted
in progress to the extent to which it does not comprehend the relationship
between problematic institutions and the rest of the social structure.  The
level of enlightenment determines the rate and extent of institutional
adjustments which can be made.  Therefore, progress begets progress.  There is
no such thing as a mature economy in an instrumental sense: the more mature the
economy, the more rapidly it matures.  The attainment of plenty does not reduce
the margin between what is provided and what could be provided--the level of
employment.</p>
