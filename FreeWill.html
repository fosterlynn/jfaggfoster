<h4 class=Body align=center style='text-align:center'>occasional paper</h4>

<p class=Body  >            The supposition that man
is endowed with some supra-causal power to create by virtue of “will” is the
root of the whole difficulty.  The technological theory of knowledge would seem
to deny the possibility of the power to choose in a free manner.  But this
denial is only a result of confusing real choices and imaginary choices.  </p>

<p class=Body  >            Everyone is aware that he
does in fact make choices, in the sense that he chooses among several proffered
alternatives.  For example, he chooses to use mahogany or pine as the material
with which to plank a boat.  Choices of this kind may be described as good or
bad, better or worse, and there is no misunderstanding about it.  His choices
serve well or less well in furthering the efficiency of the continuum of which
it is a part, and experience verifies the comparative efficiency of his
choice.  Any disagreements about such choices take the form of bringing the
facts to light, and when the facts are equally available to all disputants,
agreement is mandatory.  Neither party supposes that he can, by “will,” impute
the properties of mahogany to pine.  </p>

<p class=Body  >            This sort of experience
with factual sequence keeps man aware that he does in fact make choices, that
he does in this very real sense have free will.  But when the deep conviction
that man is actually supra-evidential and, therefore, creative in a non-causal
manner comes into play through the operation called “choice”--and particularly
when this conviction or habit emanates into pronouncements about aspects of
experience about which there is little evidence at hand--then the shift is made
from real choices to suppositious choices.  In this shift, the conclusive
evidence that man does make real choices in the technological sense lends
itself as unconscious support to the notion that the choices after the shift
also are real.  The latter are then called “choices” as if they were of a kind
with real choices, although the conceptual operation designated by the word is
exactly reversed.</p>

<p class=Body  >            The difference between the
two kinds of operations is seldom apparent because of the myth that man can
give real embodiment by wishing or wanting or by merely “saying the word.” 
Since any word almost invariably can be used to designate a referent
established by experience, and since the word  may be defined as designating
any additional conceptual content the word-user cares to impute, the imputation
is seemingly given the same reality as the evidential referent.  And it is this
“free” ability to designate content by “choice’ or “at will” that the objector
to the technological approach insists is “free will.”  Then, shifting back to
the fact that people do make choices, he pronounces that the technological
theory denies the possibility of free will and that this denial is a
contradiction in itself because denying in itself a “choosing” operation.  What
the objector is doing is this: he is insisting that the imputation has the same
reality as the evidential referent.  Though the imputation be pure figment, the
use of the word with evidential referent is sufficient to give reality to the
figment and therefore validity to the figmentation.</p>

<p class=Body  >            The whole of the
pre-Darwinian concept of man may be summed up as the theory that man has the
capacity to create by figmentation or by arbitrary designation or by
“definition.”  This sort of shifting from the actual to the suppositious, from
the real to the unreal, from the existential to the non-existential, has led
economists into the fallacy of making efforts to create by definition and then
using the “definitions” as basic data in analysis.  That analyses so based do
not in fact offer real answers to economic problems is notorious.  Since
economic problems are perforce factual problems, answers must, likewise
perforce, run in terms of the facts.  And the run of the facts allows no
apriorist imputations; the facts themselves are the necessary bases of
analysis.  When the basic concepts in traditional economic analysis are
examined with alert attention to the kind of shifting noted here from
evidential referents to apriorist, arbitrarily imputed “meanings,” the
pertinence of the present discussion to economic theory becomes apparent.  Consider
as examples capital and labor.</p>

<p class=Body  >&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body  >            Capital: 1) goods,
producers’ goods, goods required in the production process, the</p>

<p class=Body  >                                    physical
instruments of production.</p>

<p class=Body  >                           2) that, by
virtue of ownership of which, one has claims on--power to withdraw--</p>

<p class=Body  >                                    goods
offered in the market.</p>

<p class=Body  >&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body  >            The latter (2) is shifted
to priority (basic data) as referent by imputing it to the former (1) by
identifying them as the same thing.  Then, since (1) is irrefutable, (2) is
given real substance.  It then may be taken as a basic datum, drawing validity
from the former.  That the two referents are entirely different things is a
difficulty the surmounting of which can be explained only on the power to make
true by statement, by “willing” it so, by arbitrary definition.  And when the
identity is questioned, it may still be attained by admitting the distinction
and then proceeding in discourse to shift as the occasion requires and thus
continue to use (1) as supporting the reality of (2).</p>

<p class=Body  >&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body  >            Labor:  1) creative
effort; activities involved in carrying on the technological process  </p>

<p class=Body  >                                    that
is the economy.</p>

<p class=Body  >                          2) that in
return for which one person is paid by other people in claims on---</p>

<p class=Body  >                                    power
to withdraw--goods offered in the market; performances that are</p>

<p class=Body  >                                    sold
directly in the market and that are determined by the purchaser who</p>

<p class=Body  >                                    retains
sovereignty over the character of the activity.</p>

<p class=Body  >&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body  >            The word “sold” draws
solidity and validity of content from the obviously valid referent encompassed
in (1).  By shifting to the “selling process,” that process achieves “real”
substance from the reality of (1).  Labor (1) is obviously and inescapably
necessary; labor (2) is sold in the market; therefore selling is a necessary
function attached to labor.  It is even carried to the point of saying that all
sales are, at bottom, sales of labor.  And the “utility” analysis (with its
refinement in marginal utility analysis) is merely a way of calibrating the
quantity of labor in other than time units.  It too reduces all sales to
creative effort with the effort measured in terms of sacrifice or “pain” rather
than time units.  The two presuppose each other.  Then the identity can be
worked both ways: a return of claims on the market is <i>ipso facto</i> proof
of contribution to the productive process.</p>
