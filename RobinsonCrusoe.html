<h3 class=Body align=center style='text-align:center'>Robinson Crusoe</h3>

<h4 class=Body align=center style='text-align:center'>occasional paper</h4>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Let us consider the
Robinson Crusoe example: the castaway goes about providing for himself.  His
initial efforts are directed toward immediate satisfaction of the food
requirements which could not await fulfillment through the more “roundabout”
techniques.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            But having established
procedures to assure the continuance of the economic process with the tools and
materials at hand, he notes that more fish may be acquired by the use of a net,
and more goats may be brought to hand with a trap.  He sets about providing
these instruments.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Now in the classical
example, it is supposed that he needs to save or accumulate fish and goat-meat
in sufficient quantities to support him while he constructs the new equipment. 
And toward this end, it is further supposed that to accomplish the new
techniques Crusoe must eat fewer fish in case he is already fully employed, or
work longer hours in case the initial techniques have not required his full
energies.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            What activates Crusoe? 
What determines his choice to build the new devices and use the new
techniques?  Is it that he calculates the pain and abstention involved in
making traps and nets?  Is making nets more painful than grabbing fish with the
bare hands?  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The simple fact is that
Crusoe envisions (invents) more efficient procedures, and that his present rate
of production permits him to adopt them.  In case he is presently “fully”
employed in hourly surviving, Crusoe makes choices toward efficiency quite as
well as if his present techniques provided surfeit.  For example, he will fish
the lee side of a bar rather than the windward side in case fish are more
abundant on the protected side.  It is inconceivable that there could be <i>no</i>
choices even in this <i>reductio ad absurdam</i> example.  It is true that the
more efficient his current techniques are, the more opportunity he has to
experiment with new devices and procedures.  But this is merely a
differentiation in degree, not in kind.  In either case he merely adopts the
more efficient techniques in the technological sense.  If he did not act in
this manner, he would be universally regarded as insane.  In fact, in the
traditional story, if he did not act on the basis of technological efficiency,
he would cease to be regarded at all because he would cease to exist.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            There is one circumstance
in which Crusoe is not judged to be insane if he acts otherwise than on the
basis of technological efficiency: the circumstance of Crusoe’s harboring
taboos.  In this case, those who hold the same taboos might consider Crusoe a
hero and paragon of wisdom even though--or even because--his resistance to
technological progress results in his very destruction.  Those who do not hold
the same taboos might consider Crusoe deluded and misguided, and they might
even think him vicious, but they would not label him insane.  To them, Crusoe
may be the subject of evangelistic efforts or he may be the object of warlike
expeditions, but he would not be considered a fit incumbent of insane asylums. 
His sanity comes into question only when he displays conceptual inability to
apprehend technological processes.  This would be obvious, for example, if he
tried to catch fish on the dry sand dues instead of in the water.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Action on the basis of
mana and taboo does not involve inability to apprehend technological processes,
and so, does not involve insanity.  But it should be noted that action on the
basis of mana and taboo, as such, <i>does have the same incidence</i> as insane
action.  The only difference between the two is that the insane act is the
result of inability, whereas the mana or taboo act is the result of
unwillingness.  Their incidences are identical.  action based either way
attains efficacy only by accident.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            It becomes apparent that,
even in the Robinson Crusoe situation, the real locus of meaning and efficacy
is in the technological processes and not in any system of apriorist propriety
formulations.</p>
