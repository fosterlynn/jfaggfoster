<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

Investment is capital formation is debt. Then the only way you can save is to
go in debt.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            Keynes takes the position that you can increase
savings by taxing income.  The classicists say that the rate of saving
determines the rate of investment. Keynes says no, the amount of investment
determines how much can be saved.  Both, of course, hold that S=I. Keynes says
that under the classical assumption there could be no depression.  The
determinants of savings (and therefore investment) are in the decision to
invest, not in the decision to not consume or to save. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            In the underconsumption analysis, hoarding is
thought of as the part of income not spent for consumption or investment.  But
income is receipt from sales. You can sell consumption or investment goods. 
What is hoarding a receipt from the sales of?  It can’t exist.                      
         Individually, you can hoard.  That is, you can receive income that you
don’t spend for either consumption or investment.  But by the amount that you
hoard, someone else goes in debt, and for the community at large hoarding is
zero. </span></p>

font-family:Arial'>INVESTMENT</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            Investment is expenditure made with the
expectation of gaining a return. It is the expectation of change, not the
quantity of funds, that is important. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            The inducement to invest is a function of the
rate of interest and the marginal efficiency of capital. The latter is the
ratio between the prospective yield and the supply price. The prospective
yield, A-U, is symbolized by Q.  Add up Q1, Q2, etc., and you get the
prospective yield. (The supply price is the price necessary to induce a
producer to produce an additional unit of capital; it is not the market price.)
The ratio between prospective yield and supply price gives us the marginal
efficiency of capital. The schedule of the inducement to invest is that
schedule that will bring that ratio to unity. The rate of discount that will
bring the prospective yield into equality with the supply price is the marginal
efficiency of capital. (The marginal efficiency means the efficiency of each
additional unit. It doesn’t refer to aggregates.) The extension of investment
in any particular capital asset causes the marginal efficiency of capital to
decrease, although the aggregate efficiency increases.  The schedule of the
marginal efficiency of capital will not alone give us the rate of investment. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            Investment flows toward those industries in
which the marginal efficiency of capital is highest. A schedule of the marginal
efficiency of capital of all industries will give you an investment schedule,
but you still don’t know what investment will be because you still don’t have
the rate of interest.  Investment will continue as long as the investor thinks
he can make more money there than elsewhere.  The entrepreneur can hold his
money in case, or buy an existing debt, or buy capital assets. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            The multiplier is the ratio between the increase
in income and the increase in investment that occasioned that increase.  It is
the reciprocal of one minus the marginal propensity to consume. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            The difference between the classicists and
Keynes on this point is that the new expenditure never disappears, according to
the classicists.  If an additional dollar is invested, it continues to be spent
in full. The multiplier is infinity, and the ratio of acceleration is unity.
Keynes says this isn’t true, because people don’t spend all they receive. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            Without knowing the time it takes for the
multiplier to play out, you don’t know how much is required to raise the income
a certain amount.  If you know the ratio of acceleration, you know how much you
have to spend. The multiplier gives you aggregate income; the ratio of
acceleration gives you the rate of increase of income.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>THEORY OF INTEREST</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            Both the classical and the Keynesian theories of
the rate of interest could stand a little investigation. They’re both complete,
but both suffer from difficulties. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            Every asset has a rate of interest—the “own rate.”
The own rate of money is the rate of interest.  If the own rate of wheat is
greater than the own rate of money, people will prefer to buy wheat.  In order
for people to buy any asset, therefore, its own rate must be greater than the
rate of interest.  Otherwise, people would prefer to hold money, because:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            1. Its carrying costs are low.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            2. It doesn’t depreciate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>The own rate of money is generally the highest own rate.  It
is the rate equal to the marginal efficiency which other assets must attain in
order to sell.  It is chiefly a matter of liquidity: people <u>will</u> hold a
capital asset the marginal efficiency of which is below the rate of interest,
but they <u>will not</u> hold a good the own rate of which is below the rate of
interest. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            The rate of interest is therefore the most
important own rate, for the above reasons. Another reason is its low
elasticity. In this sense it is different from other commodities.  You can’t go
into the business of making money.  The power of the bank to produce money is
set by law as to quantity, and so the incentive for making money doesn’t work
the same as the incentive for making automobiles. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            The money rate of interest is usually higher
than other own rates because:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

increase in the rate of saving when we</span></p>

font-family:Arial'>                have an increase in the rate of interest.
Rather, the rate of saving decreases. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

the supply of savings?  The rate of</span></p>

font-family:Arial'>               interest does not; it is a payment for
parting with liquidity.  It would seem to follow that </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>                the inducement to invest is that schedule
which would bring the marginal efficiency of </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>                equilibrates the demand for and the supply
of money. Three determinants of demand:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>                        a. The transactions motive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>The rate of interest is, in fact, sometimes low at the
bottom of the cycle and sometimes high.  It does not have much effect as such
on the amount of investment. It has effect only indirectly through its effect
on the marginal efficiency of capital.</span></p>

least unique) investment of savings. Keynes </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>Investment will continue until the marginal efficiency of
capital is equal to the rate of interest, and no further.  The investment
demand schedule is the aggregate for all types of assets, which will bring each
of the marginal efficiencies of capital into equality with the rate of
interest.  The investment demand schedule is the demand for capital.  It varies
inversely with the rate of interest, given the marginal efficiency of capital. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            The classical theory holds that a higher rate of
interest results in more saving and thus in more investment.  Keynes says that
a rise in the rate of interest results in a drop in the rate of investment and
thus a drop in the rate of saving.  The latter is in fact the case.  Therefore,
the rate of interest is not the payment for saving, as the classicists hold. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            <i>Ceteris paribus,</i> an increase in the
quantity of funds would result in a lower rate of interest, which would result
in a higher rate of investment.  (In fact, there are other factors which may
prevent a fall in the rate of interest in response to an increase in the
quantity of money. That is, “other things do not remain equal.”)  Thus, burying
funds in the ground for people to dig up is better than nothing in a time of
depression.  But building a hospital is better.  Here he differs with the underconsumptionists. 
Keynes says you get additional purchasing power and the hospital too (which is
a capital asset.)  The underconsumptionists would say that building a hospital
would give rise to too much saving.  It would increase consumer demand but would
also increase saving, and saving tends to be too high. </span></p>

expected and unexpected expenses in the future.  Also to be able to take

something.)  Varies directly with Y.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

knowing better than the market what the market will do.  Knowing what changes
will occur as a result of expected changes in the rate of interest.  (You can
shift only in differential liquidity, not in aggregate liquidity.)  Expectation
of gain through a variation in price.  It is different from
investment--expectation of gain through the use of an asset--and from gambling
in which gains and losses exactly offset each other; in speculation, this is
not necessarily true.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

rate rises.  Banks would probably then be inclined to supply more funds, that
is, to create money.  Individuals are the same as banks in increasing supply
insofar as they make available more of what they hold.  The difference is that
when banks lend they <u>cannot </u>make use of what they don’t lend, while when
individuals lend they <u>can</u> make use of what they don’t lend.  The lending
power of both is reduced, but the kind of liquidity preference is different in
each case.  The motives for liquidity preference would seem to be a little
different in the case of  banks than in the case of individuals.  The
transactions motive doesn’t apply to banks; all they need is enough money for
day-to-day transactions, and they can get this from the Federal Reserve Bank. 
The precautionary motive applies to both, but perhaps a little differently.

font-family:Arial'>THEORY OF PRICES.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>Take off from the quantity of money theory.  If effective
demand varied directly with the quantity of money, then, “So long as there is
unemployment, employment will change in the same proportion as the quantity of
money,” etc.  If there is full employment, price changes.  But there are some
difficulties in this.  Keynes explains prices, then, as a deviation from
Fisher’s equation, by virtue of some complicating factors:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            1. Effective demand does not change in direct
proportion with the quantity of money.               </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>               Liquidity preference also affects effective
demand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            2. Resources are not homogeneous, so there will
be a decreasing rather than a </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>               constant return as employment increases and
you get an increase in price before</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>               all factors are employed. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>     3. The factors are not interchangeable.  There is very
little mobility in terms of</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>         interchangeability.  This results in a rise in
price in some areas while there are</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>         unemployed units in other areas.  Bottlenecks can
occur without any increase </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>         in the quantity of money. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>     4. The wage-unit will tend to rise before full employment
is reached. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>     5. Remuneration of the factors at the margin does not
change in the same proportion </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>         as an increase or decrease in the quantity of
money.  Marginal productivity varies in</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>         different firms. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>Thus the theory of prices might be stated a little
differently.  An increase in the quantity of money will raise both employment
and prices, and as you approach full employment the increase in prices is at a
faster rate than the increase in employment, and you approach true inflation. 
So inflation keeps you from full employment.  On the other hand, it affects the
ratio between the rate of interest and the marginal efficiency of capital
through its effect on prices. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            What is the relationship between the rate of
interest and price?  Is there a peculiar, functional relationship?  Or can we
say no more than what Keynes says?  Primarily, the effect of the quantity of
money on price is through the rate of interest. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            Why do you hit true inflation before full
employment?  Resources are not homogeneous; they are not completely mobile. 
You will hit bottlenecks in certain areas because of some stoppage of supply
(labor, land, or something), and prices will go up in those areas.  Certain
commodities can command terrific prices.  In Keynesian theory, here is the
connection between monopoly and inflation.  Monopoly makes the bottlenecks
appear sooner in relation to the level of employment—the less close you can get
to full employment.  Monopoly is in a position to increase prices. In effect,
monopoly is a bottleneck—a way of increasing prices rather than production.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            In fact, you can’t hit <u>true</u> inflation; it
means a price level of infinity.  You reach neither full employment nor true
inflation.  First, you hit such a degree of inflation that the economy can’t
operate.  It breaks down before you hit <u>true</u> inflation or <u>full</u>
employment.  [But it is due to approaching true inflation, not to approaching
full employment.]</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            Last year [1948] when the production and
consumption of wheat were at an all-time high, there was more of a glut of
wheat than at any other time—a substantiation of Keynes’ theory.  In fact, the
rate of investment turns up after an increase in income.  This too supports
Keynes.  The better things get, the better you expect them to get, and the
worse they get, the worse you expect them to get.  The underconsumptionists say
that the inducement to invest is greater when consumption is low, because
people expect things to get better.  And the inducement to invest is lower when
consumption is high.  That’s not true. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            In Keynes, something outside the market process
has to happen to increase income.  In the market process, things would just
keep on getting worse.  Credit is outside the market process.  The quantity of
money is determined by government fiscal policy and central banking policy,
both of which are determined independently of the market process. </span></p>
