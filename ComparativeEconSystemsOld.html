<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">There are two aspects of this 
course, one concerned with the isms and one concerned with the economics. 
The literature deals with the first. Actually, there are no isms; they 
are important, like Santa Claus, not because they exist but because 
people believe in them.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   All economies, 
of necessity, are mixed. There never was an economy that was capitalism. 
Economies are discernible in terms of isms because isms affect the structure. 
They do so in two ways:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  1. They actually constitute 
the prevailing kinds of institutions. Most of our institutions</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">      
are capitalistic in character.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  2. Most institutions 
(of another ism) are affected in a definite and a particular way by               </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">      
the existence of the belief in the ism that does prevail.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The Cold War is 
a struggle not between two economies or even two isms, but between </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">persons who believe in two 
different isms.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Start with capitalism 
in our study. It constitutes a theory of progress, an accumulation of 
the things that produce the means of life (capital). It has direct influence 
on all non-capitalistic institutions, such as a university, which is 
not capitalistic. If education had to be attained through the market 
process there wouldn’t be any. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The literature 
on capitalism is very confused. It speaks of things that are peculiar 
to capitalism that aren’t. </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">3-31:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The reason that there cannot 
be a pure ismatic economy involves the theory of history. The aspect 
of the economy that gives us trouble is the institutional aspect. The 
life of the economy has two readily identifiable categories;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  1. The technological</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
Physical engineers, not economists, are specifically concerned with 
problems in this </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
area.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  2. The institutional</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">      
This aspect has to do with persons and with people. It is as important 
as the </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">      
technological. The economic process cannot go on without correlated 
human </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">      
behavior. It is about this aspect that we get excited and fight wars. 
And it is with </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">      
institutional problems that economics is concerned. Isms are institutional 
factors. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">      
They are also systems of validation of these same patterns; they are 
disclosures of </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">      
what ought to be. Every institution performs two kinds of functions:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">      
1). The provision of the means of life. (Instrumental.)</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">      
2). Arranging people in some kind of power system, power being used 
to mean </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">           
discretion over other persons’ behavior. (Ceremonial.) (Freedom means 
discretion</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">           
over your own behavior.)</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">All institutions perform both 
of these functions. It is the latter about which we get </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">excited. We don’t understand 
it very well. It has kept us from solving our problems.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Institutions have 
nothing to do with physical things, but only with relations between 
persons, e.g., private property. Ownership of land does not change the 
character of the land, but it does affect human relationships. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Capital is also 
an institution. (Karl Marx named capital.)  Capital isn’t machinery; 
the Russians also have machinery. We have a tendency to use the word 
capital to mean both physical goods and an institution. The literature 
on this matter is very confused. We say you have to have capital to 
produce, meaning physical goods. That’s true. Then we say you have 
to have saving to have capital, meaning relationships. That’s not 
true about capital meaning physical goods. But is this true? Don’t 
shift from physical tools to the relationships when you talk about capital. 
Determine whether you are talking about the instrumental or the ceremonial 
function of capital. We got the institutional all mixed up with the 
physical aspect.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Economic problems 
are resolvable only in terms of the instrumental, and resolution requires 
that we effectively correlate the institutional with the technological. 
Because of this fact all economies are mixed. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   We thought we 
had technological unemployment. We blamed unemployment on tractors. 
When we wanted to raise income in the thirties we destroyed physical 
goods. That was the only way we knew to solve the problem. We were forced 
to admit that we were hungry because we had too much food. Farmers didn’t 
have enough income. What is income—stuff or money? We thought it was 
money. Another example of confusion between these two functions. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The only way to 
solve economic problems is to make adjustments in institutions. Choices 
in the field of technology are clear: we choose the most efficient way. 
In institutions we don’t do that because we confuse the two functions.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The isms are patterns 
of institutions. Our predominant ism is capitalism. We and the Russians 
can’t solve our problems because we refuse to make the necessary institutional 
adjustments. Solving a problem means doing something physical through 
institutions.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Revolutions are 
never successful. You can’t destroy an institutional structure and 
start over again. You can’t carry on the economic process without 
institutions. For this reason we sometimes think that technology and 
institutions are the same thing. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">4-1: Capitalism</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Things that are <u>not</u> 
peculiar to capitalism:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   1. Machine technology. 
Capitalism is <u>not</u> machine technology, although it is frequently </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
so presented. All isms involve machine technology.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   2. The accumulation 
of capital goods. Capitalism is not that.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   3. Mass production.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   4. The getting and 
the spending of money.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   5. Selling what 
one produces.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Identification 
of capitalism.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   1. Private property 
is usuallylisted. It is not peculiar to capitalism unless you get down                        </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
to what the term private property actually means. In its generic meaning, 
fascism and</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
communism also have it. What is private property? It is an institution. 
What </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
identifies it? What is common between the ownership of a toothbrush 
and a railroad?</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
You can own both, but you have <u>no </u>
discretion over the use of the latter. What is in</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
common is that you have a right to acquire title to the returns from 
the use of it and</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
nobody else can get the returns. This gets very close to capital. Property 
isn’t </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
necessarily material. It may be a leasehold or a patent or a debt or 
a contract or a </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
franchise. The federal reserve banks are owned by the member banks. 
They are </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
private property. But the banks cannot use the returns from the federal 
reserve banks</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
even though they have title to it. Thus it is seen that private property 
has very narrow</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
rights peculiar to it. Almost every item has a different bundle of rights 
constituting</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
ownership. The only right peculiar to private property is coming into 
possession of</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
(gaining title to) the return from it. You can have private property 
in other ismatic</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
systems than capitalism, but you can have other isms without it and 
you can’t have</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
capitalism without it. Fascism does not require private ownership; capitalism 
does</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
require it. Without private property it wouldn’t be capitalism.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   2. The processes 
of production and distribution are controlled by owner. (This is </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
clumsily said but we have no other way to say it. Government ownership 
is not the    </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
same institution as private ownership, but the word ownership has to 
suffice for both.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
Government is an institution set up by members of the community to carry 
on the</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
political process. But government property or ownership does not necessarily 
mean</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
that the government can gain a return through what it owns; it is often 
against the </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
law. In private ownership, you can gain a return. In government ownership, </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
entrepreneurial decisions are made by the government, whether the government 
is a</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
dictator or the people.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   3. The profit 
motive is peculiar to capitalism. We accept it as the specific motive: 
get as</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
much as you can for as little as you can. However, it is very difficult 
to identify </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
profits, because they are zero in the aggregate. Thus, even there are 
no profits, the</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
profit <u>motive </u> is essential to capitalism. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   4. Buying and 
selling is the only means accountably recognized as contributing to 
the</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
economic process. That is to say, the central economic structure is 
the market. For </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
example, to determine income we add up sales. Buying and selling is 
the </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
accountancy; we have no other way of accounting it. Keynes does make 
some effort </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
at getting at income by other than sales (A-U), but what he subtracts 
from sales is</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
what goods <u>could have been sold for.</u></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   5. Concept of 
natural order (with reservations).</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
Qualification: All other isms conceive that “you have to make it that 
way.” They </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
speak of natural meaning proper, not automatic. In capitalism, that 
which is natural</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
is what would exist if you didn’t do anything about it. The theory 
is that capitalism</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
would exist if you didn’t do anything about it. The other isms are 
sort of God’s</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
naturalness; capitalism is nature’s naturalism: it’s just that way, 
without enforcement</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
by man or God.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">4-4:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Property is a vested interest, 
recognized by law and enforceable by the community. A </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">laborer’s job is in some 
sense his private property. A serf’s “job” is not his property; </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">therein lies the distinction 
between the serf and the modern laborer. A serf’s job was a sort of 
permanent contract; he could not quit it. A labor can quit his job but 
he cannot</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">sell it. It is thus a vested 
interest but not <u>exactly</u> private property. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Loucks’ position 
is that voluntary savings used in the formation of capital is a</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">requisite to capitalism. This 
is a rather difficult position. A theory that there are no</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">voluntary savings would require 
holding that there is no capital formation and no</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">capitalism, to be consistent 
in the above position.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Remember the distinction 
between systems and isms. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Continuation of characteristics 
of capitalism:.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We use the caption private 
property to cover a great many institutions. In Adam Smith private property 
was about the same as capital. Now this is not true. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Another positive 
peculiarity of capitalism is the profit motive. What causes men to act 
so as to provide the means of life and experience is the profit motive. 
It pervades the community’s behavior in a quite definite fashion. 
The profit motive is not peculiar to any other economy than a capitalistic 
one. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   What is profit? 
Return from the use of capital. <u>Interest</u> is payment for the use 
of funds. Interest is cost; profits are paid after the costs of the 
factors are paid. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Is the University 
of Denver a capitalistic institution? It is privately owned. Who owns 
it? The Board of Trustees doesn’t, nor does the government. If there 
is no profit, what’s the difference who owns it? <u>Nobody </u>
owns it. The institution of ownership is not universal; it is not essential 
that someone or even an institution own everything. The University of 
Denver isn’t socialistic. It isn’t an ism. W have developed ways 
of providing the means of life and experience other than the isms. If 
we relied only on the isms, we wouldn’t have a university. Universities 
never pay for themselves. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   In most enterprises 
we act as if the motive were the profit motive, and in many (perhaps 
most) there is an attempt to make a profit. Constantly we ask ourselves, 
“Can we afford it?” Economics discloses that anything technologically 
feasible is financially possible. The question “Where Is the Money 
Coming From?” is pertinent to individuals but not to the community. 
The idea that we can’t have a high income because we can’t afford 
it is nonsense. We pay for things by making them. We can afford <u>anything</u> 
as a community. Making things creates income; that’s what income <u>
is.</u></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Business did not 
know how to make war goods without profit. That’s the way it works.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   We act as if fighting 
a war were a matter of profits, because we don’t know any other way 
to do it. It bothers us a little. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The profit motive 
permeates institutions where there is no reason for a profit. We ssort 
of apologize because the post office doesn’t make a profit. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">4-5:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">In a capitalistic economy we 
compute income as receipts from sales plus what receipts would have 
been from goods and services produced by not sold. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   A common position 
taken is that which holds that big business is destroying capitalism 
because it is destroying competition. There is an insistence that you 
must have competition to have capitalism. Destroying competition destroys 
institutions essential to capitalism because competition forces owners 
to engage in maximal production for the community. By deciding the maximize 
his income he automatically decides on the greatest production of which 
he is capable. The classical theorists (and the classical theory is 
the theory of capitalism) point out that anything that destroys competition 
destroys the validity of capitalism. Anything that interferes with competition 
is bad. (From  Smith to von Mises.) The joint-stock company (corporation) 
was not capitalistic, according to Smith; he placed it in the same section 
as government enterprise. The basing-point controversy: the Supreme 
Court held that its function was to enforce competition whether entrepreneurs 
liked it or not, to preserve capitalism. Collaboration in restraint 
of trade is illegal. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   That has given 
us a lot of trouble. Berle and Means have this idea in mind: that big 
business is contrary to capitalism.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Monopoly is established 
for the purpose of cutting production, in order to make money. Obstruction 
of a new technique is an obstacle to progress.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">4-6:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The only way you can pay a 
debt is for someone else to create another one. The entrepreneur’s 
income is called profits. Profits are zero in the aggregate.. Some firms 
make a profit and others a loss. There are two forms of loss, bankruptcy 
and debt. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Competition is used in two 
different senses:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   1. In the classical 
sense, it is that situation in which there are so many sellers that 
no </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
one of them can affect price. For this kind of competition there is 
no verb.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   2. In the other 
sense, it means a struggle for the market. For it, we have the verb </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
“compete.”</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   But a struggle 
for the market is thought to result in the beneficent effects of competition</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">in the classical sense.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   R.H. Montgomery 
thinks that in the second sense of competition price is driven not to 
average cost but to incremental cost. Then profits are less than zero. 
He may be right. But this situation requires homogeneity of product 
and conditions, and this is almost impossible of achievement. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Competition is 
in fact that which permits capitalism to perform its function—that 
of providing the means of life better than any other ism. This is the 
classical position. And competition is very difficult to achieve. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Then along comes 
Keynes with a different theory. Income is determined by propensity to 
consume and inducement to invest. The latter comes from the relation 
between the rate of interest and the marginal efficiency of capital. 
And competition reduces the m.e.c. Thus it seems that competition lessens 
the wealth of the nation. So some are again beginning to call economics 
the dismal science. You have to be poor to provide the means of life, 
it appears. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The fact is that 
there is some struggle for the market almost everywhere, even among 
monopolists. They are competing for a larger share of the consumer dollar. 
That kind of struggle has the same effect as that of competition as 
conceived by the classicists: it forces prices down. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Competitive firms 
don’t cut production in times of depression. Monopolies may cut 100%. 
And prices in the first instance go ‘way down and in the second instance 
vary hardly at all. Thus competition seems to be a benefit to everybody 
except the farmer. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   But the analysis 
lauding competition doesn’t seem to solve our problems. What does 
determine competition? You can’t have competition in telephones in 
Denver, because of the technology involved. Then how about monopolistic 
competition? Two firms, for example. It won’t necessarily work. The 
only way you can sell more is to sell it for less, and you defeat your 
purpose of earning income. You can’t have enough firms in those enterprises 
in which a few optimal firms can supply the market. The optimum  
size of plant in technological terms determines whether you’ll have 
competition, monopolistic competition, or monopoly. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   When enterprises 
are operating under conditions of decreasing costs and are struggling 
for the market, prices are driven to below cost. Railroads are an example, 
so we regulate price. We don’t let them compete. But we talk as if 
we love competition. If competition is allowed in the case of railroads, 
monopoly results. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Does or does not 
competition destroy the wealth of the community?</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">4-7:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Dilemma: Competition doesn’t 
exist except in very small areas, yet it is held by many to be essential 
to the existence of capitalism. These men say that capitalism does exist. 
What’s wrong? </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Thomas Jefferson

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">FASCISM</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">There are two kinds of concepts 
of fascism, the most common of which is that it is a sort of further 
development of capitalism. (Marxists hold this; many of the classicists 
sort of too.) The more liberal classicists hold that it is a different 
kind of thing than capitalism—a lower middle class revolution. The 
class that Marx thought would disappear—the petty bourgeoisie—continued 
to increase as a proportion of the population. It has risen in large 
numbers primarily as a result of the institutional device we call the 
corporation. The owners are not responsible under this structure, nor 
are their assigned representatives, the managers. The corporation is 
responsible; it is a legal person. It has had a peculiar relationship 
to the development of the lower middle class, the petty bourgeoisie—the 
holders of securities, etc. Their interests as an economic group are 
bound up with the maintenance of the corporation, they think. This class 
grabbed political power when it appeared that things might break up, 
and thus gained control of the economic process, and thus made capitalism 
work when it would have failed otherwise. This notion prevailed in much 
of Europe as the explanation of the origin of fascism. Big men as well 
as petty bourgeoisie supported it because they had to.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   These are the 
prevailing notions of the explanation of fascism. They do not stand 
up under rational observation.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Communication 
falls down when you lose faith.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The idea of fascism 
gives students a lot of trouble because it is irrational theory. It 
doesn’t even claim rationality. “Action precedes theory.” Action 
is good; sense is not.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Another difficulty 
with fascist theory is that it is very scant. They feel no inclination 
to explain things. They deny the validity of explanations. But they 
can’t avoid explanation, so they do explain. And you can’t avoid 
the application of theory.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The fascists had 
purpose, and screamed it to the world. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Fascism appeals 
directly to emotion and prejudice, and intentionally so, defying anyone 
to distinguish between bias and reason (or science). You answer questions 
by authority (force), not by reason. But authority defies divine right, 
using instead the fact of accomplishment. The demonstration of the fact 
of power is a complete demonstration of of the capacity to exercise 
power. Result of action, not of reason. Thus the great man theory of 
history (developed by Nietsche): that history is the result of actions 
by men in power. Combine with this a theory of the state which is not 
“class” theory, but a theory of the state as such, more nearly akin 
to the Roman concept than to the modern capitalistic conception. (Glimpses 
of Machiavelli and Sorel.) Rejects democracy not only as undesirable 
but as impossible, because of the lack of ability of the average person: 
he has not demonstrated his ability to attain power. Democracy is government 
by the least able as demonstrated by action. Many democrats have been 
convinced by the same theory, but they think democracy is worth it anyhow. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Of course the 
validity of democracy stands on the fact that it is the most efficient 
means of solving problems. But fascists don’t mean the same thing 
by solving problems. Authoritarian theory of validation: things can 
be made true by an appeal to authority, the exercise of power. They 
solve problems by simply stating an answer. Kings have always had the 
same notion. Kings can do no wrong, nor can dictators  They have 
demonstrated rightness by attaining power. They get down to the fundamental 
datum in human nature, the thirst for power. Not altogether different 
from prestige drawn from Veblen, nor from the modern anthropologist’s 
notion of prestige. He has demonstrated that which emanates from the 
fundamental motive of human nature, the thirst for power.</font></p>

----------</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Fascism is anti-rational and 
thus particularly troublesome. How can you base a theory upon a denial 
of theory? It holds together, however, in that action takes place on 
the basis of it. It has influenced behavior. Its repudiation of rational 
theory does not disallow specification in the theoretical sense. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   A theory of history 
that is a concomitant of fascist theory is the great man theory of history. 
Might makes right. Authority is that to which one appeals for validation. 
Almost becomes “What is, is.” The actual exercise of power “is.” 
What determines human behavior is the exercise of power, they say. Whoever 
exercises power has in fact accomplished it. (Use of rationality to 
prove non-rationality.)  Democracy is of course the silliest way 
to go about determining policies. Democracy is inefficient at solving 
problems. Therefore it cannot survive. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Literature going 
with this: Carlyle, Nietzsche, etc. Democracy is the rule of stupidity. 
Fascism is the rule of great men. Power begets power: the position of 
power is to get power, no matter what you say. Only fascism can result. 
That’s what wrong with government by the elite; the fascists say that’s 
what’s right about government by the elite. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Democratic peoples 
have learned that you can’t have a government of experts. They are 
good hired hands but not good governors. College professors always think 
they should run the government, but the people won’t listen to them. 
When a professor gets in power, he has two problems: (1) problems to 
solve in the economic sense, (2) problems of maintaining power. If you’re 
in power you have to act in terms of maintaining power. That’s why 
you have to watch the structure of the institutions—set them up so 
that authority can be maintained only by following the will of the people. 
That is the only answer, and it is the theory of democracy. If you’re 
a legislator, you determine policy. To be re-elected, you have to do 
as the people want. You can’t depend upon the man in power; you have 
to set up institutions so that to stay in power you have to proceed 
according to the judgment of the community. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Distinction between 
fascism and democracy: under the authoritarian theory, the concept of 
a solution to a problem is different from under the democratic theory. 
Truth is a matter of authority; the dictator can make things true by 
declaring them true. When problems arise, he “solves” them by declaring 
them solved. Problems are in the minds of people. The trouble is that 
problems aren’t in the minds of people; they’re not determined by 
what people think of them; they’re not figments of the imagination 
(goblins). Resolution involves relations between order and the problematic 
situation. There is order in a graveyard. Order and problem-solving 
are closely related, but they’re not synonymous. Fascists remove articulate 
evidences that a problem exists. They keep order, but they don’t remove 
the problem. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Examples of U.S. 
and Germany both trying to build war machines. She  got a head 
start and had more materials under the command of Hitler. He said, “Let 
there by 40,000 airplanes per year.” The president of the U.S. said, 
“We’ve got have 50,000 airplanes per year.” By 1941 we had produced 
about 20,000 planes in our entire history. It was pronounced impossible 
in our state, but the possibility was admitted if we were fascistic. 
We started producing 100.000 planes a year. We made a lot of noise, 
we didn’t have order, but we solved the problem. We whipped Hitler 
with airplanes. He had twice as many people as we, and “discretion” 
over all of them. But he didn’t get the planes. His claim of solving 
the problem was not valid. He didn’t solve the problem; we did. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Authority is still 
a potent weapon. We pay deference to it. The theory of the state, as 
well as the theory of history, is a necessary concomitant of this kind 
of validation.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">4-11: </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The attainment of power is 
a fundamental motivation and a natural function in human behavior—a 
fascistic idea. This is not altogether different from Veblen’s notion 
of prestige. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Fascists begin 
with the dictum that all men are created unequal, in contrast with Jefferson’s 
that all men are created equal. Both are unquestionably true. Further 
examination reveals that they are not talking about the same thing. 
The distinction grows out of Veblen’s distinction between technology 
and institutions. It is true that all persons are different; they are 
not equal. Variations in any one attribute are quite great, such as 
in length of noses. People vary. Some learn more rapidly than other, 
usually in some areas more than in others. The fascist imputes to those 
differences another kind of difference, that of which Jefferson was 
speaking when he said that all men are created equal. The word “invidious” 
might be used to describe the idea. (There is a lot of reasonableness 
tied up in the idea of sportsmanship, but the fascist idea does not 
recognize the validity of reason.)  The fascists made invidious distinctions; 
that’s what they’re talking about. Men are unequal because the power 
hierarchy says so. Invidious distinctions are set up. Jefferson says 
this is nonsense. The actual differences among men form no basis for 
the invidious differences. Paine agreed with Jefferson: man can have 
no property in man. Fascists say that since power is the end and some 
attain power while others do not, men are unequal. They get a nice harmony, 
as do the classicists, between what ought to be and what is, regardless 
of the rules of the game. The plea is, ultimately, why not now, like 
the communists. Better facilitate what will happen anyhow. (Economic 
power is not an end in itself; it is a means to power. The fascists 
and the communists use it. In capitalistic theory, <u>economic power 
is power. </u>Those who control the money are thought of as having political 
control too, sort of naturally. Real power is thought of as economic 
power. That kind of thinking was pretty well set in Germany at the time 
of its collapse, a la Menger. Faced with a dilemma, political leaders 
said, okay, we’ll keep you capitalists in power. Hitler wasn’t thinking 
that. He said, sure, you can have the money, what do I care? The Krupps, 
etc., weren’t worried, and neither were the Americans. The business 
leaders had the money, so Hitler was harmless. But Hitler knew better 
all the time. He had an economist named Dr. Schacht, and they weren’t 
in view of the Menger/BoehnBawerk/</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">vonMises, etc. theory. They 
wanted power as such. They made all the big business leaders monopolists, 
and if Hitler didn’t like what a businessman did, he shot him. Hitler 
had the power. The theory held by the capitalists exploded. Germany 
bewildered many economists. She even sought an unfavorable balance of 
trade, and she rearmed with it. She didn’t have any money, but she 
bought and sold things all over the world. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The same distinction 
permitted Veblen to predict in <u>The Natur of Peace</u> that Germany 
and Japan would have to go to war and why. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Most men have 
almost always sought power, but the theory that it is “natural” 
is pure imputation. The exercise of power is a cultural emanation of 
a much more fundamental  characteristic of man. Power is associated 
with honor, prestige, etc., and is permitted because of a lack of understanding 
and rationality. If you can’t understand something, the only solution 
is force. That is the only answer to enforcement of a non-evidential 
solution. Our history shows that that is the only answer we have had 
much of the time. Our ignorance has forced us to be unreasonable and 
authoritarian. Mathematicians don’t use force; they use evidence. 
In some areas we’re still using the former rather than the latter. 
The historical struggle for power is the cultural result of ignorance. 
Power is the only way to stop the use of clearly irrational theory. 
(The belief that the king can do no wrong can result in war, and often 
has.) Fascist thinking does not inevitably lead to war, but given our 
cultural heritage, it does lead to war, because that’s the only way 
we know how to do it. Fascist education is pure and simple propaganda. 
(Education equals propaganda.)  In valid theory, education is an effort 
to look at evidence. In the U.S. we can inquire, find the evidences, 
and present them, with tolerable efficiency (absence of interference). 
In Russia, they try to prove dicta specified by the authority in power. 
In pre-war Germany, likewise. All the scientists knew better, but science 
is invalid. The fascists and communists differ in almost every respect 
from each other. They developed an elite, a state conceived as a spiritual, 
ethical entity beyond the persons who make it up. The state is power, 
preserved by the elite who have demonstrated their ability by the attainment 
of power. There is one who is most elite, the dictator. He has absolute 
power. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The fascist says, 
“My theory is that all theory is nonsense.” That makes sense to 
him. Then he enforces whatever views he happens to choose—the dictator 
does, that is. He solves problems authoritatively. Nietzsche: “Nothing 
is really right or wrong; only thinking makes it so.” Thus the importance 
of propaganda. It’s very simple. Fascism necessarily follows from 
this kind of thinking—good and bad have no substance in fact,</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">aside from thinking about good 
and bad. But they are wrong. Good and bad, right and wrong, are a question 
of fact, not of authority. Problems have existence in fact. The existence 
of a problematic situation cannot be avoided. History teaches that, 
if it teaches anything. Men have been trying to solve problems by the 
application of force for thousands of years, but a problem has never 
been solved by force. (Only imaginary problems have.) Apparent contradiction: 
sometimes you have to use force in order to have a chance to solve problems. 
But it is still the understanding of the problem that solves it, not 
the use of force. Example: wars are won by technology, not by force, 
but force results from technology. Atoms don’t pay any attention to 
authority. Human problems are the same way. The difference is that you 
can convince humans that the existence of a problematic situation is 
good for them, e.g., that hunger is good for the soul. But it doesn’t 
solve problems. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The word “relativity” has 
often bogged down students of the social sciences. We got it from Einsteinian 
physics, which is constant, not relative. If you can’t have a constant, 
you can’t have science. Relativity is a misnomer. The idea of relativity 
is the realization that everything else adjusts accordingly—in Einstein 
everything adjusts around energy, in terms of energy. But we tend to 
use the word incorrectly. In Newtonian physics it is purely relative; 
there are no constants. Each thing is defined relative to something 
else, and we get a circle. And it’s true, as it’s stated. But its 
universe is much smaller than that of Einsteinian physics. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Good and bad in 
a sense are relative. But they’re not two different aspects of the 
same attribute, they’re different attributes. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   If a question 
is not a question of fact, it is not a question. Dewey makes it clear 
that it just doesn’t make sense. A question as to which ism is best 
is nonsense. A legitimate question, which sounds something like it, 
is as to whether it is better for people to believe one ism than others. 
That is a question of fact. A question of opinion is a question of fact. 
Theory is fact. Correctness of theory is another problem.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">    Most of 
our difficulty comes from our consideration of ideas. When we’re talking 
about the behavior of human beings, we’re talking about facts. When 
we’re talking about ideas, we can talk about the idea as an idea, 
or the fact that the idea represents. We shift from one to the other 
without knowing it. Look to your tools when you start to handle a problem. 
Fashion your tools with a rational approach. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   We associate scientific 
validity very easily with persons, just as we associate authority with 
persons. You don’t learn to be scientific, period; you learn about 
specific problems. Knowledge of one sort does not transfer to another 
problem. You have to learn about the facts of the problem at hand. That 
fallacy in our thinking comes up in our idea about technocracy—letting 
the engineers solve our social problems. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Science is a matter 
of arranging facts in causal terms, in line with a theoretical formulation, 
which is a theory of value, a criterion of judgment. You can’t disregard 
the value problem and make any kind of analysis, in <u>any</u> field, 
math included. Philosophical principles are like mathematical principles 
in that they’re either true or they aren’t. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Some of the institutionalists 
have taken a naïve reaction to that sort of thing. They seem to get 
out of Veblen the idea that all this stuff is nonsense, so you don’t 
need to fool with it. That’s not true. Mythology determines why we 
wear neckties and why we kill each other. It’s important. </font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Utopian Socialism:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Utopia has come to mean a situation 
in which all problems have been solved, and therefore one which is unattainable. 
They (the Utopian socialists) didn’t think it unattainable, but were 
called Utopian by those who objected to their doctrine.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Many of their 
concepts have entered importantly into proletarian radicalism of the 
twentieth century. The Utopian socialists were a product of the age 
of reason, having that concept of human nature. The age of reason was 
right in saying that men really are distinguished from other species. 
Man has a peculiar nature; it is an identifiable function of rational 
capacity. Man has really got it. He can learn vicariously. He is a theory-creating, 
theory-applying animal. He can conceptually project (teach) what he 
knows. No other animal can do that; the other animals have to experience 
something to learn. We got mixed up in our educational philosophy in 
this area, when we started saying you have to experience something to 
learn. That just isn’t true; if it were we’d be as dumb as dumb 
animals. Man has capacity to reason. Social theory is based on that.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Fourier had some 
ideas on that score. Validity is attained by conforming with the intentions 
of nature, in human affairs with human nature. Happiness is attained 
when we get congruity between human behavior and human nature. Social 
order is founded on natural laws. The discretion of human should be 
exercised to attain this congruity. (This is nonsense, but it gets some 
right answers.) </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The classicists 
were looking at the continuing factors in human behavior to get at human 
nature and thus arrive at basic assumptions on which they based their 
deductions.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Fourier looked 
at this and said that man is by nature perfect. Get his actual behavior 
into conformity with his natural behavior. Let him act according to 
his instincts. Institutions prevent this.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Fourier and his 
colleagues were right in looking at the continuing and inclusive factors. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   It is difficult 
to determine whether Fourier was an anarchist or a socialist. Sort of 
both, as were the classicists. Adam Smith had two basic motives, self-interest 
and sympathy (good will). The first is primary, but the other had to 
be invented to  explain actual behavior. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Fourier had twelve 
of these attributes, in groups identified in terms of their effect on 
social behavior: (These attributes are instincts.)</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  A. First group: has 
the effect of disrupting social behavior, keeping men apart, lessening </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
their efficiency, keeping them from cooperating.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
1. Ambition</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
2. Rivalry</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
3. Vanity</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  B. Second group: tends 
to bring people together, to correlate, to carry on the social  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
process.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
1. Friendship</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
2. Sex, love</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
3. Parental instinct</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
4. Desire for harmony</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  C. Third group: the 
five senses</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
1. Sight</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
2. Smell</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
3. Taste</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
4. Hearing</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
5. Touch</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   They were confused 
about instinct, as we still are, Fourier probably less confused about 
it than our modern psychologists. (Sight can probably better be identified 
as an instinct than can pugnacity, for example. It is more outside the 
area of discretion.) Most persons tend to mean as instinct things like 
pugnacity, love, hatred, anger.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">4-14:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Why shouldn’t we establish 
democracy in Germany? And are we or are we not attempting to? We haven’t 
set up anything yet; they still have a military government. We don’t 
know yet exactly what we want to set up. Maybe we should know, but we 
don’t.  There is a problem. The Germans are politically the most 
immature in Europe. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The Utopian Socialists 
were writing around the early part of the nineteenth century. Their 
system of validation: congruency with nature—characteristic of the 
thinking of that time. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Fourier listed 
instincts as causing people to act in certain ways. The next step he 
took was to rearrange the institutions so that these basic factors in 
human behavior could operate without interference. He had the notion 
that, this accomplished, the human capacity to reason would become useless. 
All social problems would be resolved, and man could apply himself to 
areas of technology and esthetics. No institutional problems, but not 
a stoppage of progress. (Quite like Marx in this respect. Different 
in theory—he wouldn’t change it, he would just look at it a little 
differently, and it would work. But Utopian Socialism rejected firmly 
the classical general theory.)</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Fourier’s chief 
objection was the inefficiency of the economic process. He noted people 
going hungry in Paris with thousands of tons of food being garbaged 
because it couldn’t be sold for a profit. He said eating was a natural 
process, and the institutions interfered. Most of this, and all similar 
situations, occurs because of the interference with the free exercise 
of human behavior. You have to cooperate with Nature. On the surface 
that seems reasonable to most of us, but if we look more carefully we 
find that’s not what we want to do. We want to thwart the intentions 
of Nature—kill weeds and make dams, etc. But that’s not what Fourier 
thought. Somewhat like Rousseau in the idea of institutions.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Fourier was not 
concerned necessarily with inequality of income, because some of it 
might be in conformity with the basic instincts. He would not destroy 
private property. Product would go instead as follows: </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     One-third 
to labor</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     One-fourth 
to management</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     Five-twelfths 
to property owners (/)</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   But not all income 
was to be so distributed. Every person would receive a minimum, established 
by determining what he needed. What was left over would be distributed 
as indicated. Each individual could work any amount, with anyone. The 
phalanx would allow for the propensity toward rivalry. Forty or fifty 
groups, identified according to groups, such as carpenters. They would 
strive to outdistance each other, so that a carpenter could invidiously 
compare himself with a farmer, etc. An outlet for dispersive passions, 
variety, etc. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Then how would 
you get people to work? Three answers:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     1. 
Determination of how much a man would get over the minimum would be 
in part at   </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
least a function of how hard he worked, a connection between reward 
and effort. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
He thought that work was in some sense painful. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     2. 
He would make work play. It is painful not because of the kind of activity 
but </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
because of the opprobrium to it. Don’t call fishing work, and it’s 
play. If you don’t</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
make it the wage system, the source of the dishonor is removed. Make 
it    </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
competitive play. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     3. 
No regulations at all. Everything completely free. No wages. No coercion.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Now, is all labor 
of that kind? No, some is not fun, regardless of the institutional arrangements. 
Leave this “dirty” work to the children, in the form of apprenticeships. 
matter of discipline. (He was wrong.) He backed down a little about 
the matter of honor and dishonor. Cleaning sewers and sweeping chimneys 
couldn’t be made honorable or fun exactly, so let the children do 
it. They wouldn’t mind it as much, anyhow. Thus the stigma would be 
removed, and men will be eager to work. (Some truth here, as Veblen 
pointed out.) Brisbane expounded Fourier’s idea in the U.S. He wrote <i>
Social Destiny of Man, </i>which had considerable effect. Converted 
Horace Greeley to the idea. They succeeded in setting up about forty 
phalanxes in the U.S., the most important of which was Brooks Farm. 
Sylvania was another prominent one. The most successful one, the North 
American Phalanx, 1834-1854, didn’t have as much capital (one-fifth) 
as Fourier thought necessary to set one up. Also only about one-sixth 
of the necessary population. A lot of problems arose from the peculiar 
situations that they encountered in the phalanx experience. The experiment 
failed, and the proponents always attributed this failure to lack of 
capital, population, etc. (Incidentally, most of the phalanxes were 
made up of a bunch of “characters” who didn’t know how to act 
correlatedly.) By definition there could be no anti-social behavior 
and thus no problems, but there were. Men fought, etc. But there could 
be no reason for men fighting over a woman, e.g. The rivalry was supposed 
to be taken care of by the team arrangement. It wasn’t. But of course 
thise could be blamed on the surrounding communities. Such men just 
hadn’t learned; they were acting like children. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   No courts were 
needed. Everyone decided everything. Four thousand to six thousand was 
the proper outside limit on population: what Fourier thought it would 
take to operate an economy. Perhaps true when he was a boy, but when 
he was writing it took more than to have sufficient division of labor. 
So came the idea that there should be less division of labor—man should 
be well-rounded, able to do a lot of things. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   There are still 
several Utopian Socialist colonies in the U.S. and Canada, but not Fourier 
colonies. There are several Owenite ones. The Utopian Socialist colonies 
do not have religion mixed up with them—Age of Reason instead. But 
most modern ones similar to them have a religious basis. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   How do you go 
about setting up this system? Set up the phalanxes as examples to show 
the world how things could be organized. When men saw them, being rational, 
they would become aware that everyone was happy with little effort and 
rush to do the same thing. You could hurry this revolution through propaganda. 
Not a class strubble, but tell people, in an effort to get them to see 
the light. Ignorance is the real obstruction to attainment of the natural 
order. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">4-18: Robert Owen</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Concept of human nature different 
from that of Fourier. Owen thought of it as the “clay-tablet” concept. 
Experience writes character and personality; the person is like a soft 
clay tablet. Humans are essentially rational; what is wrong is the institutions. 
It does not mean that you are not born with specific propensities, regardless 
of the effect of institutions. Not natural propensities, rather no propensities. 
Man is naturally reasonable and learns such things as rivalry, etc. 
Fourier’s man was not quite as reasonable as Owern’s. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Owen was an apprentice 
at an early age. He early started inventing mechanical contrivances. 
He went into business at nineteen and did extremely well. At twenty-three 
he went into the textile business and established a plant considered 
the most nearly perfect model in the world. In 1813 he wrote “A New 
View of Society,” settmg down notions that we now would call benevolent 
capitalism or something like that. He thought employers should think 
of their employees as people. He did several astonishing things at New 
Lanark: He did away with child labor (those under ten), abolished the 
pauper apprentice system, reduced the working day to ten hours. These 
actions were presumably raising his costs, and yet he made the greatest 
fortune in Britain, the first to make a huge fortune out of the Industrial 
Revolution. He was a most successful businessman, despite his “unbusinesslike” 
methods. He sought to install a functional educational institution, 
in which he tried to instill habits of cooperation rather than of competition. 
He began to envision a whole world fashioned after New Lanark, but he 
didn’t get many supporters among the businessmen. His success didn’t 
make sense to them. His principles were’t right.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   In 1819 the Factory 
Reform Act was passed, advocated by Owen. He had considerable influence 
because of his success as a businessman. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   As he continued 
to observe, Owen decided that philanthropic capitalism wouldn’t work, 
and he became a socialist. People would not follow his New Lanark experience. 
The institutional structure of society would have to be reorganized. 
So he organized some new villages as plans for society at large. He 
was doing well. The community was frightened. They couldn’t attack 
him as unacquainted, because he was such a successful  businessman. 
But he made a mistake along here somewhere when he attacked religion 
(denounced it and sin). That gave the community a chance to attack him 
on the basis of his agnosticism. He thereafter lost respectability; 
his enemies were able to dissuade “nice” people from listening to 
him. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Owen got fed up 
and came to the U.S. in 1824. He bought New Harmony, in Indiana, to 
install a village of cooperation. He sank his whole fortune in it, and 
it broke him and failed in three years. Frances Wright became involved 
in it, however, and decided to try to buy freedom for the slaves. She 
didn’t have enough money to do it all herself, and others didn’t 
respond very well, so she failed. She was also among the first woman 
suffragists. . She made some headway. Josiah Warren, the first American 
anarchist, was also a member of New Harmony.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Owen went back 
to England, with no fortune, and decided to establish co-ops. He began 
to study economics seriously and made the discovery that money is sterile. 
(Like Aristotle’s discovery.) He also discovered the labor theory 
of valuation—from the literature. Then it hit him that money is just 
a way of working out the real value (which is comparative labor content), 
so you should distribute more of it. So he set up his co-op on the idea 
that each man would be paid according to the amount of his labor. Then 
there would be no depression—taking off in part from Lauderdale’s 
theory of depression. But members used the co-ops to dispose of good 
they couldn’t sell in the regular market, and sold regular goods in 
the regular market. Ratios of exchange grew up between these “labor 
chits” and money from the open market. Operations grew up that caused 
the co-ops to fair. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Owen had tried 
four things—and failed every time. He still stuck to his basic theory. 
He decided to try one more thing—trade unions. He organized working 
men not as a bargaining agency but as a means of achieving socialism. 
He was a great organizer. The first thing they did was bargain for higher 
wages, and Owen tried to show them that this wasn’t what organization 
was for. Some even went so far as to strike, which was directly opposed 
to Owen’s philosophy. He had failed again. He recognized that there 
was something wrong with the economic theory he was applying. His theory 
was something like this:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     1. 
All value comes from labor.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     2. 
Labor receives only a part of the money value that it creates.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     3. 
Therefore it is impossible to recover the goods from the market.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     4. 
Therefore the defect lies in the money system, because there is no correspondence</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
between money (founded on gold) and money’s worth (founded on labor.)</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     5. 
If workers received the money’s worth of what they produced, all goods 
could be </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
sold.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">4-19:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We like repetition, but if 
it excludes other behavior, it’s monotonous. Doing nothing is monotonous, 
but doing nothing isn’t monotonous in itself.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Shortcomings and 
contributions of the Utopians:</font></p>

1. Overlooking the degree of interdependence of the economic world.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">        
2. Overlooking the fact that people <u>believe </u>
in class interests, even though they </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The idea of social 
and economic progress is a very important matter. Almost all other</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">4-22:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Marxism</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">They are not so different from 
the Utopians as they claim. Marxists hold to “scientific” socialism, 
Utopians to “non-scientific” socialism, they say. A conception of 
a society with no social problems is in fact unscientific. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">(We cannot refuse to solve 
problems, nor can we reach a Utopia. But we can go on, solving problems.)</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Marx himself: He was German, 
had a Jewish father. He was extremely precocious. He came into pretty 
clear view of the major social problems that confronted the western 
world. This at an early age—about fifteen. He arrived at answers by 
twenty, and spent the rest of his life proving and expounding them. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Marxism is important 
because it is determinative of much of the modern community. Many people 
believe in it. Marxism is the basis of communistic and much modern socialistic 
theory. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Marxism is the 
heterodox (revolutionary) form of the classical theory. The fact of 
Russia is sufficient to require that we learn as much as we can about 
the belief that has occasioned the recent impasse in international intercourse. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Marx began very 
fervently to try to explain the sorry state of things. He had a conviction 
that something was fundamentally wrong. He decided early how things <u>
should </u>be. Then he found tools for his analysis. Two main ones—sources 
of Marx’x conceptuology:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     1. 
Hegelian dialectic: German background.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     2, 
English classical economic theory, especially Smith and Ricardo.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   From Hegel, Marx 
got his dialectic—his way of determining truth, sequence in rational 
determination. Motion or movement occurs as a result of comparative 
placement and direction and strength of the forces of thesis, antithesis, 
and synthesis. Like Newton’s concepts of  (1) equal and opposite reaction 
and (2) motion continues until something happens to stop it. Application 
to historical theory, to Marx, involved explaining how institutions 
came about. He adopted the classical concept of class interest and the 
Hegelian concept of dialectic. Institutions have to do with groups of 
people. The theory of history consists of the development of a thesis 
in the form of a dominant class determining the behavior of the community; 
the development of an antithesis, not like, or opposed to, the thesis, 
determined by economic function; and finally the synthesis, resulting 
when the antithesis develops enough force to move the thesis. Revolution. 
Then this process starts over again; synthesis becomes thesis. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Then there is 
the theory of logic, or reasoning, set up in contrast with formal logic. 
Minor premise, major premise, conclusion—syllogism. Marx said formal 
logic was not true. Things in fact don’t happen the way the classical 
philosophers, especially Greek, reasoned. Marx said reasoning had to 
be in conformity with the problem to which it is applied. But he didn’t 
go far enough.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   In regard to the 
theory of history:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     1. 
The only thing about which we can be certain is change. Not an assumption 
but a</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
demonstrable fact. Change is constant. Change is a reality.</font></p>

to history, Marx asked, what is the philosophy of history? What are 
the determining factors in history? You would have to find the thesis, 
antithesis, and synthesis in history. It is the action of groups that 
determines the modification of institutions. These groups take their 
attitudes from the economic structure. Making a living is the center 
of activities. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Some philosophers 
have held that there are no determining factors in history. It rests 
on the notion that human behavior is unpredictable, so you can’t have 
a theory of history. This is wrong, although some evidence seems to 
point in this direction. Marx is right in that. Of course you can predict 
human behavior. If you couldn’t, you wouldn’t have institutions. 
Some things you can predict with complete accuracy, some not at all. 
You can determine which ones can be predicted and which ones not. The 
theory of probability. You can’t predict in an individual case the 
ratio of consumption to income, but for the group you can predict it 
with certainty. Predictability varies on two axes. But you can predict 
human behavior just as you can predict in chemistry. The chemists can’t 
predict everything, for example the behavior of enzymes, because they 
don’t understand everything. Psychologists can predict the same way; 
there are some things they don’t understand and thus can’t predict. 
If you understand a person well enough, you can predict his behavior.</font> <br>

Institutions, like technology, are used for all kinds of purposes. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Back to Marx: 
The dialectic was developed by Hegel in an effort to handle process. 
History is not static. Marx absorbed much of this. The idea that history 
is evolutionary, but it goes by revolution. There is no one natural 
order. All orders contain the seeds of preceding orders. (Toynbee and 
classical economics grow out of this idea.) But strangely enough, out 
of this Marx arrived at an institutional situation in which there were 
no new orders, only more of the same. Something like the Utopians.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The theory of 
history has been a great difficulty in the thinking of scholars. Some 
say there are no determinants—a dance of the atoms, fate. But intention 
is part of the original plan, and you can’t outwit it. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   There are several 
objectors to Marx’s theory of history:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">      
1. Idealistic</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">      
2. Humanistic (will)</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">      
3. Materialistic     </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  . The first is an idealistic 
interpretation: Man will determine something, think it out, and bring 
it about. Marx and Veblen both objected to this, saying that ideals 
are not scientific. But ideals <u>are</u> subject to scientific treatment. 
Human interpretation.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The second: the 
great man idea grows out of this. It can take the form of God’s will, 
Nature, etc. Out of both one and two came the notion that you can’t 
predict, because you can’t know the causes behind human behavior. 
Either a constant or a variable. If the first, no change; if the second, 
can’t predict. So there’s no theory either way. First, no history; 
second, no theory of history. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   In the materialistic 
interpretation, history makes the man, not man makes history. Caesar 
wouldn’t have been a great figure if it hadn’t been for history. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   All these arguments 
are meaningless, but they’re common. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Hegel believed 
in the idealistic interpretation. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   In contrast to 
this is Marx’s theory, which he expressed as Hegel’s philosophy

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Although Marx 
took the materialistic view, the key was not found in something material 
but in the mode of production. It determines all other aspects of social 
life. Economic interpretation. All aspects affect each other. The primary 
one is the mode of production. This is not technology, but the <u>mode</u>, 
which is made up of the forces and the relations of production, both 
of which are institutional.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The determination 
forces and relations in capitalism, according to Marx:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     1. Separation 
of means of production and ownership. People who produce don’t own</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Objections to non-theoretic 
(dance of the atoms) theory of history made by two groups, the idealists 
and the materialists. (1) Hegelian: realities are formulated in the 
mind; the world is a projection of those operations; (2) basic realities 
are found outside of man, in Nature or God or something like that (extra-human). 
The Nature group of this second category of idealists have been attacked 
as teleological, involving a guiding-hand concept. (Like Adam Smith 
notion. Also Plato, Schopenhaur, Hegel.)</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Marx disclaims 
any relationship with idealism and disclaims Hegel’s basic proposition 
of the realities. However, the structure of the two dialectics is the 
same; the pattern of thought is the same. These two groups of idealists 
get a sense of direction in history. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The other group 
opposing the dance-of-the-atoms theory of history is the materialistic 
group. But it is the most teleological of all. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The materialists 
start with physical things and conceive ideas to be concepts growing 
out of physical things. This approach has taken many forms, such as 
are found in fascism, communism, capitalism. Race theories, survival 
theories, geographical theories, etc.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Marx thought through 
most of these factors, and he found his materialistic determination 
of history through the mode of production. The mode of production means 
the whole of the pattern of correlated human behavior that eventuates 
in the provision of the means of life, the institutional structure. 
Technologies enter only insofar as they set certain patterns of relationships 
that cannot be avoided. From the material aspects grow up certain laws 
of correlated human behavior, of necessity and inescapably. All institutions 
grow out of the mode of production—how you go about producing the 
means of life. If you don’t produce them, you die.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   What factors determine 
the mode? Two kinds of relationships among persons: (1) the forces of 
production, and (2) the relations of production. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The forces of 
production are that pattern of human relationships (institutions) that 
are specified by their actually necessary relationships in the productive 
process. These patterns are not technology as conceived by Veblen. They 
are institutions. It is on this basis that Veblen attacked Marx. They 
are inescapable. Here, Marx is right. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The relations 
of production are human relations resulting from the use of previously 
established forces turned to (or parallel-ly developed with) the use 
of discretion over other persons’ behavior (power) for the purpose 
of exploitation. That is, the use of patterns of human relations for 
purposes of attaining and maintaining power. And power means privilege; 
and privilege means exploitation. He also gets at exploitation another 
way, through his economics. It is central to his whole theory.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The relations 
of production constitute the thesis. Along beside this and counterpoised 
with it, develop the forces, which are different in character, constituting 
the antithesis. The relations and forces oppose each other. The thesis 
is old and is opposed by a new force growing out of technological progress. 
Out of this conflict emerges the synthesis, which then becomes the thesis. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Since the mode 
determines the whole of human experience, the whole of human experience 
is determined by the struggle between the forces and the relations. 
How this process gets to be revolutionary marks the diversion of socialists 
and communists. &lt;arx says it is inevitable, not in the sense that 
persons don’t have to do it, but in the sense that persons will be 
activated to do it by virtue of the conflict. There is necessary recognition 
of common interests. Out of that grows labor unions. (The Communists 
detest labor unions because they didn’t grow up as Marx said they 
ought to.)</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The only way that 
such things can occur is by virtue of multiples of such persons coming 
to agreement. Individually, it is impossible to bring about a modification 
of the relations to conform to the forces. Persons must act together, 
because the community’s agreed relation is enforced by the community 
through the State, of which the force is always greater than that of 
any individual. The individual rebelling or circumventing to escape 
the incidence of the relations only does harm by arousing the suspicions 
of the power group, who can put down individuals. Hence the necessity 
of revolution. This continues until the underlying class rises up. They 
rise up through necessity, having an opportunity to rise up when there 
is a collapse of provision of means. (The institutions do not collapse 
yet.) When a structure ceases to perform its function, the concerted 
action of the underlying persons results in revolution. So it is in 
periods of collapse that revolution occurs. But it occurs as a rational 
action. The interests of the overlying and the underlying populations 
are not harmonious, according to Marx, only by virtue of the institutional 
structure, as the Utopians say. But Marx said the institutional structure 
has nothing to do with it. The underlying populations are seeking their 
own self-interest, which is in antagonism to that of the overlying populations. 
There is not basic harmony; there is antagonism, class conflict. The 
revolution comes about through class conflict. The forces and the relations 
are tools to be used for self-interest, like an airplane.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   In a period of 
collapse, the struggle for the determination of the new mode inevitably 
is on the side of the underlying population, through technology. The 
forces of production win inevitably, even if the overlying population 
appears to win any fighting that occurs. The new mode is as dictated 
by the forces of production. The forces of production become the synthesis. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Marx is not concerned 
with the industrial reserve army. They don’t effect the revolution. 
The proletariat, the employed, effect the revolution. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Collapse (the 
failure of the institutional pattern characterized as the relations) 
is taken advantage of by the proletariat.</font> <br></p>

is the way it was outlined. But that hasn’t borne out. They explain 
it by saying that they have no state now, they have only administration. 
No force, no police control. Administrators are just bookkeepers, keeping

relies on production. But Russia still uses force; in fact, she has

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The historical theory:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">There are two aspects of any

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     1. 
The forces of production.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     2.

are not separate but interacting, and they are in contrast. No. 1 is 
changing; No. 2 is static. Therefore, there has come to be a cultural 
lag. Contradiction arises inevitably between the forces and the relations. 
This conflict is cumulative, resulting from technological development. 
Synthesis comes about through class struggle. In all stages of human 
society historically (except the most primitive and communism—the 
first and the last) there has been class struggle. The class will win 
whose interests are most nearly in accord with the forces of production, 
of necessity. It doesn’t mean that the underlying class is “good.”  
The underlying class always wins. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The next step 
in history will be the conflict between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. 
The former will of necessity win. The bourgeoisie are being forced down 
into the proletariat. Comes the revolution, they will disappear. Then 
there will be only one class. And a new theory of history will have 
to be formulated to take care of what happens after that. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Marx says that 
his theory is not one of per-determinism. Revolution comes about through 
what people decide. They can decide any way they want, but they don’t. 
They necessarily decide only one way. </font> <br> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">4-28:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Marx’s Economics</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The source of his economics 
is classical: British theory, especially as treated by Adam Smith and 
David Ricardo. It is very closely connected theory. Marx tries to determine 
to what degree the thesis and the antithesis in capitalism have worked 
out, and tries to anticipate the character of the new synthesis. He 
tries to do so by means of his economic analysis. Thus he speaks of 
his theory of history as the new economic interpretation of history. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Marx’s theory 
of value is the same as that of Ricardo, with some refinements. He examines 
the commodity, which he sets forth as the fundamental unit in capitalism. 
He defines capitalism as a commodity-producing system. A commodity is 
something that</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">(1) is produced for the market, 
(2) has use value, and (3) requires the expenditure of labor to bring 
it about. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     1. 
It is for sale.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     2, 
It depends upon the wants of the consumer and the satisfaction of those 
wants . </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Use value” involves no 
social relationships, no qualitative difference. “Exchange value”  
involves no qualitative differences but only quantitative differences. 
It starts out with the figure that in some sense or other, 1 pr. of 
shoes = 7 bu. of wheat in exchange value. What does this mean? Something 
in one must be equal to something in the other. That something is labor, 
the only common attribute of all commodities. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Exchange-value 
has only quantitative difference, use-value only qualitative. Marx has 
three theories of value: (1) value, (2) exchange value, and (3) use 
value. Value is <u>real</u> value and involves both qualitative and 
quantitative differences. It is quantitatively expressible by virtue 
of its being constituted by embodied labor (Locke). It is qualitatively 
variable by virtue of the fact that labor varies in quality. But it 
is not just the sum of exchange and use value.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   In determining 
value, which is embodied labor, Marx had to get some unit—a unit of 
value—to be used as a tool. It creates the unit that he calls the 
socially necessary labor. It can be measured quantitatively in terms 
of time; it is the time required, in the prevailing technique, using 
the composite (average modal) skill, to create a product. He takes pains 
to point out that he is not doing what Ricardo did in arriving at labor 
content. (Ricardo arrived at average labor and avoided the problem of 
qualitative differences.) Marx faces the problem that Ricardo avoids, 
but fails to solve it.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Labor must be 
socially necessary and must also produce the right portion of commodities 
that the market demands, by virtue of the forces of production. That’s 
the theory of value.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Now the theory 
of surplus value. This has taken many forms—now the theory of capital 
formation. How does the community become wealthy? Economics has always 
been concerned with this. How the surplus is explained changes from 
period to period. Marx was looking at the same thing. How, with the 
labor theory of valuation, could you get embodied labor in excess of 
the labor that is embodied? How get a surplus out of labor?</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">    His theory 
of surplus labor is the same as the classical theory of profits: return 
above real costs. The common sense idea of profits is still that of 
Ricardo—you explain everything else and it’s what’s left over, 
so you don’t have to explain it. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Marx had difficulty 
with this, as does everyone else, because when you add everything else 
up and then add up income they look suspiciously alike. But still we 
have capital formation—embodied labor. If we didn’t use up as much 
labor’s worth in creating something as the worth of the thing we created, 
we have a surplus. But the worth of a thing is the labor used in producing 
it. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   How to find a 
surplus. Marx points out that he disagrees in some sense with the Ricardo 
view. There would be no profits under conditions of competition, Ricardo 
and Marx agreed. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Inadequacy resulted 
from:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     1. 
Common acceptance of the economy as given data.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     2. 
The fact that no one raised the question of products; they just accepted 
it. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Marx didn’t 
accept it. He said if labor produces wealth, why shouldn’t it receive 
all of the wealth produced? A question of justice, a question of making 
real cost equal real contribution. (This is one of the greatest myths 
in literature—this concept of the theory of justice. Marx accepted 
it.) Somebody gets something he doesn’t contribute, something that 
doesn’t belong to him. How does Marx prove this? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Capitalists had 
two answers to this question; orthodox classical theory, that is. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     1. 
It is necessary to restrict consumption in order to save, in order to 
make possible the</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
creation of capital goods. The reward for saving (abstinence) is profits. 
If labor got </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
all of the produce, they’d consume it all, and there would be no capital 
formation.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     2. 
The productivity theory of capital (primarily coming out of Lauderdale). 
When </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
capital is used it does work in the sense that labor would have to be 
performed if it</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
weren’t for the capital—capital as embodied labor. But there is 
still the problem of </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
the surplus. How can capital embody more labor than is in it? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Marx says they 
haven’t answered the question. He answers it. All things bought and 
sold have the same exchange and real value as labor. In the case of 
labor the thing bought is not the same as the thing sold. You pay for 
labor cost, just as you pay for a chair—embodied labor in both cases. 
What you sell is labor power, and there’s a difference. That difference 
constitutes the surplus. In his theory of wages, he holds to his theory 
of exchange value—all commodities sell at cost, including labor. The 
cost of labor is as Ricardo said, quantity of labor. You pay what is 
necessary to provide that quantity of labor. You sell what he produces, 
labor power. This isn’t true of any other commodity, because labor 
is the only creative commodity. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   What labor produces 
above that required to sustain labor becomes a surplus. If ten hours 
of labor a day are required to sustain labor and you work labor twelve 
hours, you get the surplus. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Condensation of 
the theory of surplus value:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">1. Income comes from buying 
and selling.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">2. The quantity of labor involved 
in goods determines their exchange ratios.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">3. But capitalists exchange 
not to obtain equivalent goods but more money. Buying and selling must 
result in an increase of money. Buying and selling is done by capitalists. 
How can that come about? It can’t come from exchange, as the mercantilists 
claimed. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">4. Then it must be true that 
the capitalist sells something with greater labor content than the thing 
he buys. It is the difference between the power of labor to produce 
and the labor cost of labor. The cost of labor is sustenance in units 
of labor. And labor is able to produce more than its sustenance. The 
excess is what the capitalist appropriates by virtue of owning the means 
of production. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   At this point 
arises the contradiction in Marx. The first volume of <i>Das Kapital </i>
 was published about 1867. The second about 1885, the third about 1894. 
In this controversy between the Ricardian and the Marxist theorists, 
the former thought they had found a paradox— re the composition of 
capital. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   C equals variable 
capital (v) plus constant capital (c). The organic composition of capital 
depends on the ratio of (v) to (c). Some enterprises have ratios of 
99:1 and other of 1:99. The paradox arises over explaining a constant 
rate of profit arising out of different ratios. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">4-29:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Problems in surplus value arise 
by virtue of the theory of exchange-value. Use-value, on the other hand, 
is the relationship between a commodity and its capacity to satisfy 
human want. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Use-value varies 
in each individual instance in qualitative terms. Marx was carrying 
in mind the distinction between science and non-science as the distinction 
between those that can be handled quantitatively and those that cannot. 
Marx thought that it was the quantitative aspects of value that determine 
the mode of production and therefore the course of history. The use-value 
theory is not of a necessary concern as regard the course of history.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Exchange-value 
and real value (real value equals embodied labor and is therefore subject 
to numerical identification in terms of the socially necessary labor) 
are related in that, by virtue of the Ricardian theory of price, exchange-value 
is constantly being shifted toward real value. It never reaches a static 
position.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   In the theory 
of exchange-value ((theory of comparative price), a la the Ricardian 
demonstration, under conditions of competition, commodities exchange 
at their comparative real costs. Since that is the case, the problem 
of explaining the surplus arises. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Marx attacks this 
problem by distinguishing between what is purchased and what is sold 
in regard to labor. How could you get more real value out of what is 
created than the value that goes into creating it? He, like Smith and 
Ricardo, believed you can’t get a surplus out of exchange, because 
commodities sell at their real cost. They can’t sell for more. This 
is true of everything except labor. Labor is different from a commodity 
in that the labor that is embodied in it is different from what it is 
embodied in. The only place you can get a surplus is in production. 
The employer purchases labor at the cost of labor, and he sells what 
labor can produce, which is different from what he bought. What he sells 
exchanges for its real value (how much labor is embodied in it), but 
that isn’t the same quantity of labor as what he bought. The difference 
is the surplus. It can come only out of the sale and purchase of labor, 
because labor produces commodities. You can’t get a surplus out of 
buying and selling commodities. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Labor gets the 
cost of labor. It produces labor power. The employer buys labor cost 
and sells labor power, and each sells at the cost of the labor embodied 
in it. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Translated into 
numerical terms:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   If the working 
day is ten hours and it takes the worker five hours to produce what 
he gets, the product accruing during the other five hours goes to the 
capitalist. He doesn’t have to pay it to labor, and it’s a surplus. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Capital (C) is 
made up of varying proportions of (c) and (v). Variable capital is that 
which belongs to the owner and which is used to purchase labor. Constant 
capital is that which belongs to the owner but is <i>not</i> used to 
purchase labor. Variable capital is the wages fund. Constant is composed 
of things already created, such as tools. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Smith’s concept 
of circulating and fixed capital was the same as Marx’s, but later 
classical concepts were not the same. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   In view of the 
theory of exchange-value the rate of return on (c) and that on (v) would 
have to be the same or you’d have a shift of investment. But in some 
enterprises the ratio of (c) to (v) is 9:1 and in others is 1:9.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Then you have 
the problem of explaining an even rate of return in (v) and in (c) and 
in (C) for all firms. You also have the problem of explaining an even 
return to labor. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The rate of exploitation—the 
ratio between labor’s product and labor’s wage—has to be uniform, 
just as any other cost has to be uniform. If the rate of exploitation 
were 50%, the following would result:</font></p>

paradox is never resolved. The great dilemma.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Example: A is 
a hydro-electric power plant. B is a strawberry plant. The incentive 
is to maximize profit, which is return on C. Profits must be equal in

ratio of what he produces to what he gets, S/v, which is the rate of 
exploitation. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Engels says you 
must distinguish between value and price. Goods tend to sell at money 
cost instead of real cost, which is an abandonment of the labor theory

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">5-2:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ricardo attempted to explain 
the proportion of income going to various classes. This led to the differential 
rent theory and to the labor cost theory of price. Only profits and 
wages enter in the determination of price. Ricardo thought the capitalist 
class was the most important; Marx thought the laboring class. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Marx was concerned 
with the rate of receipt of the various factors, not only with the proportion 
of the total going to each. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   To Ricardo, that 
paid to labor is a hindrance to the formation of capital. Marx said 
that if you increase that paid to labor, you don’t necessarily decrease 
capital assets. </font></p>

that Marx’s theory was not developed to explain exchange prices.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The laws of capitalist 
development, according to Marx, stand on two major premises constituted 
by the theory of value and the theory of surplus value. The laws of 
capitalist development are inevitable tendencies inherent in a capitalist 
society. (These laws are really Ricardo’s demonstration.)</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     1. 
Tendency toward a falling rate of profit.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     5. 
Tendencies toward crises or depression.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Conflicts arise 
(Hegelian dialectic) by virtue of the unequal development of the forces 
and relations of production. The laws of capitalist development constitute 
that condition. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Discussion of the laws:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">1. The same as in Ricardo. 
As capital is accumulated, the laws of supply and demand inevitably 
enforce a reduction in the rate of profit, even though there may be 
an increase in the actual quantity of profits. The rate of profit is 
S/C. As capital is accumulated, the supply of capital and the demand 
for it do not increase at the same rate. Thus with technological advancement 
there is less opportunity to earn a proportion of money’s worth of 
equipment. An increasingly greater proportion of C comes to be comprised 
by (c) and less by (v). Inventions are labor-saving devices, necessarily 
so in a capitalistic economy because at bottom labor is the only cost. 
The entrepreneur has no control over price (aggregate demand schedule 
taken as given), so all he can do is vary production, and not all can 
do that. Beyond that, he can change the method of production. That means 
an increase in (c) as related to (v). Also, there is an inevitable tendency 
toward monopoly.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Thus, says Marx, 
the classicists admit that the very foundation of capitalism (profits) 
diminishes and eventually destroys capitalism. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Contradiction: 
the motive destroys itself. The more capitalists you have, the less 
profits you have. Thus Ricardo says you’ll reach a state of equilibrium—a 
“mature” economy. Ricardo says capitalism doesn’t die, it just 
reaches a state of equilibrium when profits are brought down to costs 
(rather, a very narrow margin of profits). No incentive to invest and 
no incentive to withdraw capital. But Marx said capitalism would die. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Granting the capitalist 
assumptions, it is true that profits go down. The labor cost of labor 
increases. There is an inescapable tendency toward a falling rate of 
profits.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The capitalists 
could not avoid this because the prevailing method determines price. 
For example, you have monopoly.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Ricardo: the niggardliness 
of Nature is the cause of poverty. Marx: the accumulation of capital 
causes poverty. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The other laws 
came out of the first one.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">2. Ownership tends to go into 
fewer and fewer hands as a proportion of the population as a whole. 
The size of each unit increases. Certain forces tend to bring this about. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     a. 
A limited frontier.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     b. 
Technological improvement.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     c. 
Competition. Prices are driven to costs. Entrepreneurs are forced to 
increase the size </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
of plant to keep costs down, in order not to be forced out of business. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     d. 
The efforts of individual capitalist to maintain his absolute standard 
of living. As </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
the rate of profits falls, he must either (1) be satisfied with a smaller 
and smaller </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
income or (2) increase his holdings of capital. He tends to do the latter, 
and this </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
results in fewer and fewer capitalists. Banking effects a continued 
weeding out of</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
capitalists and a buying up by others. Big business drives out little 
business. The </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
point would finally be reached at which you would do away with the capitalists.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">3. The law of the industrial 
reserve army, or “relative overpopulation.” Here Marx and the orthodox 
classicists are opposite. The classicists said there could be no such 
thing as technological unemployment. Marx said machines would displace 
labor, giving a greater and greater bargaining position to the capitalists. 
Ricardo: there cannot be any involuntary unemployment. Marx: there is 
involuntary unemployment, and in increasing amounts. The position was 
not taken on grounds that less labor would be required to satisfy wants 
or that there would be less capital to exercise a demand for labor, 
but rather that there would be a severe struggle in the labor market. 
The profit motive forbids employers to employ all of labor. (They tried 
to attack the problem that Keynes later attacks.)  Employers cannot 
bargain at full employment; when you hit full employment you hit inflation. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Counteracting 
forces to this law:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     1. 
New markets.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     2. 
The possibility of expansion of investment. But this comes to an end 
by virtue of </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">          
the first law. Marx saw the problem of overinvestment like Hayek’s 
theory of </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">          
overinvestment. Investment decreases the rate of profit and thus destroys </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">          
investment, although it may alleviate the problem temporarily. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The industrial 
reserve army is made up not of the unemployed but those permanently</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">out of the working class—the 
mob. They may now be thought of as the “unemployable.” They’re 
getting subsistence some other way than through the market process. 
Most of them don’t live very long.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">5-3:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The rate of increase from primary 
investment. When they all get to producing, you’re going to have terrific 
pressure from all the five laws. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Marxists also 
say that the conditions of Marx’s time were in conformity with the 
theory he formulated. Now it seems clear that absolute misery has not 
increased, so that must be changed to <b><i>relative </i></b>
<u> </u>misery. It is the disparity with which labor is concerned, they 
say. But that isn’t what Marx said. The disparity idea doesn’t work 
well with the idea of the industrial reserve army.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   A lot of modern 
communists don’t hold to the theory of revolution any more. They want 
to patch up the system piecemeal. But others say you can’t do it that 
way. Engels in Vol. III of <i>Das Kapital</i> finally decided that you 
could get along with the present system if you changed some of it. That’s 
when he abandoned the labor theory of value. But the communists have 
probably held to the doctrine as originally conveived to a greater extent 
than has any other group.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   As for law five—the 
tendency toward increasingly severe crises—periodic breakdowns in 
economic systems are probably pretty similar to what orthodox economists 
call business cycles. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   There are three 
elements in such crises: </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">      
1, The anarchy of production. The decisions relative to production are 
scattered </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">          
among millions of entrepreneurs (mostly independent). There is self-interest 
in</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">          
making decisions. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">      
2. On the other hand, there is collective operation of the productive 
process. It is </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">          
interdependent, closely coordinated, delicately balance. This becomes 
more and </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">          
more the case with technological development. The world becomes more 
nearly</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">          
one unit. Marx is right about this point. This conflicts with (a).</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">      
3. Also, there is an effect of capital accumulation on the rate of profit: 
it becomes</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">          
progressively more and more difficult to maintain effective demand. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">5-5:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">More about the fifth law of 
capitalist development. There are three elements in regard to the theory 
of crises:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     1. 
Anarchy of production.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     2. 
Conflict between production and ownership.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     3. 
Effect of capital accumulation.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The anarchy of 
production is usually called the anarchy of distribution. There is diffusion 
of decision-making; every entrepreneur makes decisions with a view toward 
getting as much money as possible. This inevitably leads to confusion 
and instability, primarily because of varying rates of capital formation 
in different enterprises. In the case of this unequal development, since 
socially necessary labor determines relative value in the marketplace, 
an increase in productivity in an industry causes a movement toward 
that industry at the same time that labor goes away from it. This results 
in confusion. The first entrepreneur who introduces new techniques always 
makes a lot of money, and he can bid temporarily the factors away from 
other enterprises. However, if the law of the market works, the prices 
of commodities produced by the improved technique are driven down. Here 
Marx gives a clue to the non-monetary theory of business cycles—a 
great increase in frictional unemployment. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   He also approaches 
this from another standpoint—the underconsumption approach. The capacity 
to produce goods in some instances exceeds the capacity to recover those 
goods from the market. Here he abandons the classical position on the 
matter. Marx held that you could make progress by working toward communism, 
abandoning Malthus’s theory of population. The reason for insufficient 
effective demand is that these adjustments (frictional unemployment) 
come after rather than before the overproduction, so you have a glut 
on the market. Since Keynes’s <i>General Theory</i>, however, a theory 
of gluts cannot be supported. The greatest “glut” occurs at the 
highest peak rather than at the lowest point of the business cycle.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   However, Malthus 
and Marx are looking at a phenomenon that all of us recognize. The classical 
tools, which they used, were inadequate for the problem. They were looking 
at the failure of effective demand. They were attacking Say’s Law. 
This is the distinction between Marx’s and the underconsumptionists’ 
theories of crises. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   As for #2, the 
actual physical carrying-on of the productive process is social in character. 
However, private owners appropriate the goods. The two clash. The owner’s 
behavior in appropriating the goods has no bearing on his behavior in 
producing them. When private production disappeared it withdrew the 
synonymy or harmony between the forces of production and the relations 
of production on this point, and this brought on struggle and the need 
for a new synthesis.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   As for the first 
four laws work, the terrific receipt of income experienced by fewer 
and fewer men becomes so great that this income can’t be spent. Thus 
hoarding and thus insufficient effective demand, say Malthus and Marx. 
The inability to consume all that is produced, and thus a glut. Thus 
there is an inevitable tendency toward depression. The forces require 
a new mode.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   As capital accumulation 
goes on, the rate of profit goes down, and the entrepreneur struggles 
harder to increase the rate of surplus—the third law. Thus the conflict 
getw worse and worse. The divergence of interests and opinion becomes 
very marked. This increases gradually as the severity of depression 
increases. Eventually the degree of recognition will be such that a 
depression will bring a direct attack on the relations of production. 
New orders will be established. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Marx said this 
should be done with very little bloodshed. Russia planned it that way, 
planned a bloodless revolution. It worked for about eighteen hours, 
but then it got bloody. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Marx’s theory 
of crises is not one of business cycles but rather one of depression. 
There is a constant tendency toward depression under the mode of capitalism. 
Then how explain the upswing under the Marxist theory? Later Marxists 
did. Marx’s theory is different from Malthus’s theory of depression 
in that the latter is a constant downward tendency while Marx conceives 
of upswings. How can he explain them? In periods of depression, temporarily 
the real wages are pushed down below the labor value of labor. That 
is, real wages (market wages) are pushed down below subsistence. Then 
you get a surplus that should accrue to the remainder of the community 
but that goes to the entrepreneur and induces him to produce a little 
more, hire more men. The workers stay alive during this period but wear 
themselves out. Real costs have been reduced, but not exchange value. 
The difference accrues to the capitalist, and his rate of surplus has 
been increased. The commodities produced still have the same embodied 
labor but labor gets less than the real cost and the entrepreneur gets 
more real value. Both is rate of surplus and his rate of profit are 
increased. Both the non-monetary and the eclectic theories involve this 
notion. In fact, all of the theories of the business cycle except that 
of Keynes involve Marx’s notion, although they’re not stated just 
as he stated them. Now they say when wages are driven below subsistence, 
costs are finally driven below price and the capitalist can make a profit 
so he has a notion to produce. Thus recovery. Then costs are driven 
above price by virtue of an increase in wages, and the downswing comes 
again. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">5-9:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Institutional structure in 
the USSR. The situation in which the new development took place. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The communist 
doctrine had spread rather rapidly among a narrow circle in Russia around 
the turn of the century. Russian novels, developed to a very high level 
as a medium of expression, give some expression of this. Russians throughout 
their history have been noted for personal integrity in their literature. 
They say what they mean, and they also attempt to act the way they talk--this.probably 
growing out of a very long experience with the feudalistic structure. 
Feudalism is characterized by identification of position and function 
through birth. Russians have always been feudalistic to a great degree. 
Events around the turn of the century drove home to the thinking people, 
a large part of whom were aristocratic, the idea that there was something 
wrong with their economy.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   History books 
tend to translate the Russian Revolution like the French Revolution—a 
desperate people fighting blindly. But the Russian Revolution was not 
so.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The idea of revolution 
spread so rapidly that the Czar was convinced that he should try to 
do something to remedy the institutions. These difficulties were like 
those found in any economy in a transition from feudalism to individualism. 
Russia has been industrializing for some time. Great fortunes were being 
accumulated at this time. Bribery grew up. There grew up a self-recognized 
inadequacy on the part of the aristocracy. For a time the Russians were 
forced to act one way and talk another. The ruling groups tried to make 
adjustment, establishing in 1905 what they said was a constitutional 
monarchy. They gave the citizens some voice, and ostensibly obstructed 
unlimited authority of the Czar But there was still a basic difficulty, 
much the same as it had been before. The Czar still had authority.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The problem of 
acting one way and talking another can be solved in one of two ways: 
change your actions or change the way you talk. They had changed the 
way they were talking in 1905.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   This didn’t 
last very long. World War came along. Organization became immediately 
and disastrously apparent. Russian soldiers were forces to go into battle 
unarmed while fighting a modern war. They went through it up to the 
point of collapse.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The collapse came 
from inside Russia. In the Revolution in the Karensky affair (1917),, 
an illuminating situation appeared. Karensky was a moderate. When things 
ceased to operate, the Soviets took over. They said they’d take charge 
of the food supply and keep things going until they could decide what 
to do. This went on for quite a few days, until it became apparent that 
the means of life were not being distributed. The people tried to get 
at these things. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The Communist 
party had two factions, the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks. They had 
split over what Marx meant. (The sp[lit continued up to Stalin and Trotsky, 
the two heirs of Lenin.) Lenin and Trotsky were the leaders of two groups. 
Lenin, an exceptional strategist, was able to control the situation. 
The Bolsheviks took over.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The Allies had 
sent intervention armies into Russia. We didn’t comprehend the problem 
at all. We sent a few battalions in and expected the Russians to sort 
of do as our battalions told them to do. The Russians were pretty kind 
to them. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   From 1917 to 1920 
it was a completely amorphous situation in terms of structure. The Bolshevik 
Army took over--took what they wanted without accounting for it and 
acknowledged no responsibility. After the intervention armies were out, 
they established “the dictatorship of the proletariat.” During the 
war period they tried to go all the wawy to communism. First they tried 
to do away with money but had to reintroduce it. They had to preserve 
some old institutions to give the economy some order. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   All the time this 
was going on, the fight of the isms was going on. The Bolsheviks were 
not really the majority—limited to about 2% of the population. They 
again brought out vehemently the idea of an established belief dictating 
actual behavior. (The habit of saying what you don’t mean always caused 
the other nations some trouble. Since then they’ve learned some traditional 
behavior.) The war going on was very bitter. The concept of what was 
believed best for the community was being carried on regardless of everything 
else. If anyone objected, he was killed.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The Bolsheviks 
won—got into de facto control. They then had the problem of bringing 
the practice into conformity with the theory. The struggle between the 
Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks was as to how you should go about doing 
that. Stalin won over Trotsky. Stalin had a measure of Fourier in him. 
Trotsky said this way was impossible—that a communistic nation could 
not survive in a world with other economies. Trotsky was really closer 
to Marx. He wanted violent revolution right then. But Stalin wanted 
to establish communism in Russia and let the rest of the community have 
revolts when they saw the example of Russia. So they‘re operating 
according to Stalin’s beliefs. (They’re probably still prosecuting 
Trotsky in Russia.)</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The Stalin group 
insisted that what you must pay attention to is the USSR. Yet the world 
seems to be acting as if it thinks Stalin is following Trotsky’s views. 
But Stalin has followed his original plan pretty well. He still wants 
internal revolutions. He does send agents into other countries, but 
not much aid.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Russia’s policy 
now is to spread communism throughout Europe. [This is being written 
in 1949.] We’re trying to stop it with, for example, the Atlantic 
Pact. That’s the wrong way to try to stop the spread of ideas. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Seemingly the 
Russians really believe in communism. They have reconciled their theory 
with their practice. They admit to the party only those who really believe 
in it.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Machiavellian 
and communistic philosophies are opposite in the structure of their 
theories, although they use many of the same techniques. Communists 
and fascists are very strongly opposed to each other. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The Stalinists 
decided they’d have to raise the wealth of the nation, as conceived 
by Adam Smith: (1) productivity per unit of labor, and (2) proportion 
of total population employed in producing. The determination of the 
first are; (a) the accumulation of the tools, and (b) the parsimony 
of the individual (abstention from consumption.) The Stalinists believed 
in Adam Smith right up through his theory of capital formation. They 
try to accumulate fixed capital by abstaining from consumption. They 
set up five-year plans—with amazing success—all this in an effort 
to increase the productivity per unit of labor. They also worked on 
trying to employ a greater proportion of their population. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Economists in 
capitalistic countries convinced the people in those countries that 
Russia would fall—the communist regime, that is—because they didn’t 
have any money. But of course it didn’t fall to pieces. There was 
much investment in Russia of American capital—both material and know-how—from 
the U.S., Britain, France, and even Russia. The Russians were thus able 
to build up the beginnings of what they now have—a pretty highly developed 
industrial nation. Russia passed Germany in the thirties in the production 
of pig iron. It is now the world’s largest producer of gold.</font> <br>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Up to 1936 there was considerable 
doubt as to how they, the Russians, should proceed with their plan of 
bringing about revolutions. The Constitution of 1936 describes the structure 
of Russian society. Under that Constitution, the structure is the direct 
application of communist theory to the actual situation confronted by 
that structure, as nearly as the framers could accomplish it.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The Russian constitution 
is quite similar to ours. The legislative body is the Supreme Soviet 
of the USSR—made up of two houses. Membership varies from year to 
year; it has about 1300 to 1400 members. It has two Houses, set up in 
some sense parallel to ours: the Soviet of the Union and the Soviet 
of Nationalities. The former is elected according to population—1:200,000. 
The latter is made up of various kinds of political  jurisdictions 
that have been incorporated into the Union, irrespective of population, 
even more irrespective of population than our Senate. The two Houses 
are designed to be about the same size. They are equal in power. Either 
can initiate legislation, and the consent of both is necessary to pass 
it. The Supreme Soviet meets every six months, and members are elected 
every two years. Both Houses elect a smaller group (now about thirty-four 
members), which stays in session all the time. The members of the Supreme 
Soviet are presumed to carry on their regular jobs and are called to 
session. If the Supreme Soviet cannot agree, an election is called.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The small group 
is both the executive and the legislature, but it does not act directly 
as the executive. Out of it are appointed the Supreme Court and the 
procurator.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The Supreme Court 
has thirty-some justices. The people’s courts are the point of origin 
of most all cases. These courts are made up of three members, two of 
which are not lawyers. Majority decision rules. But cases may be appealed 
to a higher court.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The Council of 
People’s Ministries (formerly called the Comissariat) carries on the 
business of government, reporting directly to the smaller group. There 
are two groups in it. One group of ministries carries on the functions 
of government. Both groups of ministries carry on political and economic 
activities of the areas assigned to them. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Almost everyone 
is elected; there are very few appointments in Russia. It starts with 
the Supreme Soviet. Anyone can run by getting a nomination from any 
recognized group. The campaign is pretty heated. But the balloting doesn’t 
occur until it has been narrowed down to one candidate. The nominees 
are voted on, however. Various nominating groups continue to meet together 
until they weed out candidates by majority vote. The one remaining must 
be acceptable to the Communist Party. He is certified and put on the 
ballot. The voters can vote either for or against him. It’s a secret 
ballot. You can vote if you’re eighteen. Before the Constitution of 
1936 you practically had to be a Party member to vote on anything. Now 
there are no restrictions as to race, etc. Historically, there is about 
a 99.7% vote in a general election, and fewer than 1% vote against the 
candidate. So the campaigning is the real thing. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   A one-party system 
does not as such mean an undemocratic procedure. It may be more democratic 
than a two-party system. You have to fight it out on the issues instead 
of according to the party. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   It appears that 
there is no interfering with voting in Russia, whether or not their 
system of final voting makes any sense. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   When the final 
candidate is certified by the Party he also has to certify that he is 
willing to serve. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Clarification 
of voting: There are other restrictions. If a person lives off others 
he can’t vote. That eliminates capitalists, the rentier, the insane, 
those in jail.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Russia is in fact 
ruled by the Soviets. There is a Soviet for every village, for every 
cooperative farm, for every republic. The USSR can take in any group 
that wants to apply for admission. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Stalin is Secretary 
to the Communist Party. He stands up for re-election every two years. 
He is nominated by someone in his home town. He always gets a 100% vote. 
He is chairman of his council. He has his finger on everything all down 
the line. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">5-11:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">An ism is a systematized body 
of theory that validates a particular institutional structure.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The Russians have 
really tried to apply communism. But the Russian economy, like all economies, 
is mixed, although it is probably more nearly communistic than any other.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   It is impossible 
to make a division between the economic and the political institutions 
in Russia.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The use of mandamus 
in injunction is about the only peculiar attribute of government.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   To gain control 
of government you get <i>de facto </i>
control of the means of life. That’s why economics is so important 
in politics.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Labor in the 
Soviet Union</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Russia has never 
had much unemployment. She didn’t have much under the feudal system.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The war cut heavily 
into her working population. Russia lost about fifteen million in the 
war, about half of whom were soldiers. The Russians fought the major 
part of the war. This loss was a very severe drain on her laboring force. 
Her problem since that time has not been one of unemployment. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   In the present 
five-year plan she expects to obtain a laboring force of thirty-three 
or thirty-four million, not including co-op farms, in the Union economy—which 
is to say the socialist economy.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Training for these 
jobs is a long story. They have established schools of various sorts 
for technicians, etc. Admission to technical schools is pro-rated out 
to the various economic institutions in the Union. They also have training 
on the job for particular job in plants. Many plants also have a school 
of their own. Then of course they have regular schools for teaching 
common tools (reading, writing, arithmetic). Their literacy is higher 
than our own; they are over 97% literate.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   A lot of people 
got rich during the war, so Russia changed her money system. She gave 
them about two weeks (this was about December 17, 1947) to exchange 
their money for new rubles. For the first 3,000 rubles she exchanged 
ruble for ruble. From 3,000 to 10,000 rubles she exchanged 2 for 3. 
Above that she practically took the rubles away from them. She also 
changed the interest rate. So those who benefited most from the war 
lost. Purchasing power was shifted to those who lost during the war. 
This was in an effort to stop inflation.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   About 85% of the 
workers in Russia belong to unions. They call them trade union, but 
they’re not; they’re industrial unions. (They do have some trade 
unions too, however.)  These national unions comprise the all-union 
congress. The smallest organized union group they call the production 
unit. They also have a shop committee and a works committee. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   These unions carry 
on certain functions, some of which are peculiar to Russian unions and 
some of which are not. They don’t bargain for wages; the government 
does that. They do act as an agent for a worker to pursue grievances. 
It reviews management policy, carries on a social insurance function, 
and provides cultural activities. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The unions cooperate 
through contracts. These contracts are designed under the supervision 
of the ministry concerned. The contracts specify only the general and 
uniform conditions. Specific conditions are left to the local divisions 
of the union and the management. They originally set up an 8-hour day 
and a 6-hour day week. Later (in 1927?) they reduced it to a 7-hour 
day with every sixth day off. They lengthened it during the war and 
since reduced it. Vacations are from 2 to 8 weeks, with pay. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">5-12:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Industrial unions in Russia 
are made up of members of a producing unit rather than members of any 
particular trade. Dues are about 1% of the income of the individual. 
Members do not participate in policy formation. A trust or producing 
unit works out a contract between the trust and the organized labor 
unit. The tendency since the war has been toward independent management 
decisions, although the laws passed by the Supreme Soviet very frequently 
specify details, such as work week, child labor, etc., so that management 
has no discretion on many matters. Russian law is very closely bound 
up with official policy—a theory of integration of the state. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Stalin understood 
history better than Trotsky.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   These unions carry 
on cultural activities. This puts some pressure on managerial decisions, 
but increasingly less so. They carry on insurance policies for the Russian 
people. They carry grievances to the courts.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The hours they 
work are specified by law. They vary for different occasions. Vacations 
are also specified by law. Teachers, scientists, research workers, and 
those who work in the far North are usually given two months’ vacation. 
They can take a bond instead of a vacation. The bond pays 2% interest. 
Through it the worker can take a vacation any time and pay for it with 
the bond. He can also take vacation without pay. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   There are four 
systems of wages: (1) time-work-rates (so much per hour); (2) time-work-rates 
plus bonus (in direct contradiction with Marxian theory but found necessary 
in order to get the work done—for industry, for example, stopped producing 
furs when communized, so it had to be capitalized); (3) piece-work (recommended 
by Marx to lessen the rate of exploitation)—quotas are set up and 
pay varies according to production; (4) progressive piece-work rates—the 
more you produce, the more you get, not only for the additional units 
of production but also more <i>per unit</i> when you produce more than 
the quota. The rate increases very rapidly as production increases. 
The quotas are set arbitrarily; they are <i>not </i>
averages. In America piece-work rates are usually thought to be a way 
to increase the average. In Russia the quota is not changed if average 
production goes up—everyone may produce more than the quota. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Their salaries usually 
include bonuses. There are also many medals and honors. Medals increase 
prestige in the community. Managers compete to get their output above 
the quota.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Discipline. The 
Russians had a lot of trouble when they first started, especially with 
peasants in industrial plants. In highly integrated tasks, when one 
stops to roll a cigarette it stops the whole process. There was also 
the problem of absenteeism and tardyism. How could they solve it without 
firing a man? Everyone has a work record that always follows him around. 
In some cases an employer cannot hire a man without his work book, and 
sometimes he can’t hire a man if his work record is of a certain character. 
The Russians delegate distasteful jobs to those with bad work records. 
So they have pretty much solved such problems. </font> <br> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">5-13:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">How does the Soviet Union go 
about determining its economic operations—its planning operations? 
We know the structure of institutions and the accomplished results in 
Russia. We lack data on how operations are actually carried on, but 
this should be fairly well “deducible” from what we do know. Decisions 
in any institution, in the absence of specific policy, are made according 
to the political potency of the individuals concerned. In Russia, where 
there is policy, it appears that policy determination is made by those 
who execute the policy. Foster’s conclusion is that there must be 
fairly uniform agreement on the part of those who carry out any plan. 
The results, in terms of weight, measure, and count, would indicate 
that. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The state planning 
commission is the highest planning authority in the Union. Its data 
are fairly reliable. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Foster suspects 
that economic policy is pretty much democratically determined. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The state planning 
commission is made up of seventy members. It initiates and finally communicates 
the plan as a plan. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   A few words about 
planning as such. The concept of planning has been kicked around pretty 
much. We have a tendency to associate planning with socialism or not-capitalism, 
which is poppycock. There is always planning; the question is how it 
shall be done. It is necessary, in the first place, that those who carry 
on the functions in any process understand the rules. We have all kinds 
of planning—the Constitution, parking ordinances, etc. The general 
outline of the plan has to be available to everyone. This general principle 
hold down to the smallest unit, even if it is composed of only two individuals. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Planning, then, 
is inescapable in any economy. The differences are in how the plan is 
determined and by whom. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The Russians set 
up a system of determining a plan that really has the force of law--to 
do it integratedly. Marx had found a contradiction  in the anarchy 
of decision-making and the cooperation of production. The Russians set 
up a state planning commission, to avoid the contradiction Marx found. 
The commission sits down and draws up a plan. The big plan is the five-year 
plan. The Russians are now in the fourth such plan. The commission has 
available to it all research reports, university work, labor union data, 
etc. Also, they have a direct connection with the state bank, which 
is set up by the council. The bank’s planning is subsequent to the 
commission’s planning. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The commission 
sends its plan down on two bases, one geographic and one functional. 
It is brought together at both ends. The initiated plan and the finally 
adopted plan come together at the commission. In its traveling it becomes 
definitive, through these two bases. The geographical and the functional 
channels revise, consider, and change the plan until it gets to those 
who are to carry it out. Those who have discretion in carrying out a 
certain plan look at it and change it as they see fit. Then the plan 
starts back up, its parts being brought together on the way. It is reexamined 
in the light of the total plan, all the way up. Coordinators look at 
all parts of the plan, seeing how the parts interact. When it gets back 
to the commission, it brings together the two sources or channels, geographical 
and functional. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   When we say “planning,” 
sometimes we mean an investigation of what’s going to happen, the 
projection of trends into the future. The Russians think of it as an 
investigation, or determination, of what <i>ought </i>
to happen. (Of course we have planning in this sense too.) The plans 
have two major problems involved: (1) the problem of keeping it flexible 
enough to accommodate to variations in determining factors (such as 
drought, war, etc.), so that changes can be made immediately. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">5-16:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Economic problems are involved 
in financial aspects of the plans. The Russians try to keep the financial 
planning in as close a parallel with the physical operations as possible. 
The effort is to keep purchasing power in those particular enterprises, 
and for consumer goods at large, in equality with the price tags in 
those markets. They try to keep profits in equality with what that enterprise 
will buy. On the consumer side, they try to keep payments to the factors 
(labor, interest, and profits) in conformity with the prices they set 
in government enterprises. They have been way off in keeping effective 
demand in conformity.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   There is the problem 
of estimating the character of production in terms of consumer purchases. 
How do they know how many red shoes, for example, to make? (One of the 
common sources of gain is in the difference between law and custom. 
In any economy, there is almost always considerable gain to be found 
by taking recourse to one and then the other. Bootlegging example.)</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   (The mores principle 
denies the value theory of institutional adjustment.)</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The Russians of 
course have confronted such problems, and they have tried to meet them 
with institutions headed by the State Bank. Most operations are carried 
in Russia, as here, through credit. The Bank makes loans and gives credits, 
clear on down to individual plants and persons. Credit for consumer 
use is restricted (in dates of maturity) as a matter of policy to the 
periods intervening between receipts of income by the borrower. All 
banks are integrated into one group under the heading of State Bank.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   One problem they 
haven’t been able to solve is that of the impact of the rate of profits 
on goods in the market. The Planning Commission and the State Bank estimate 
profits so as to parallel or equal the flow of price tags. If a man 
sells produce under very favorable conditions, things get fouled up. 
He has too much purchasing power, so someone else can’t get the goods 
he wants to buy. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Attempts to solve 
this problem: They try to make public figures on production, and they 
encourage the purchase of products of which there is an over-supply. 
They have been unsuccessful in this. It has resulted in the continuance 
of a difference between accepted procedure and the law and thus a continuance 
of private business, the thing they want to get rid of. However, they 
have kept the problem within tolerable limits. They use medals, the 
universities, etc., to try to mould public taste. But they don’t worry 
too much about that problem because they ultimately expect it to disappear—a 
state reached in which goods have no price. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Re the problem 
of keeping purchasing power equal to goods and services and keeping 
money up to the task of commanding these goods and services: The Russians 
allocate the materials and provide money for their purchase. But they 
have found it more efficient just to let money take care of allocating 
materials. When money is borrowed the loan is paid not by the enterprise 
that borrows the money (if that firm makes a loss but is thought to 
be economically desirable) but by other firms that make a profit. So 
security is almost without meaning in the Russian banking system. Here 
is the essential difference between her system and ours. They keep track 
of loans not to make a certain person liable for paying but just as 
a matte of bookkeeping (in line with planning the money system). They 
are not bound by pecuniary requirements except as an entire nation. 
If things seem not to balance they have to find out where the “missing” 
money went. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   They agree that 
supply and demand are physically equal—like Ricardo. They disagree 
with him that money is automatically parallel with and equal to the 
distribution of goods. They make it true by law; we think it’s automatically 
true.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Another problem 
is the matter of the character of investment and the rate of investment. 
In our economy that depends on (1) the calculation of the investor as 
to the rate of effective demand for the product in question, and (2) 
banking policy and government fiscal policy. The Russians don’t do 
that at all; they know exactly what the market policy of an enterprise 
will be. How do they go about determining whether to put in a shoe factory 
or a diaper factory? They don’t go by the price system; they merely 
use it as a device. They decide through planning. The Planning Commission 
decides the proportion of the total resources of the community that 
will go into a particular commodity, such as textiles. They do so not 
in terms of effective demand, as we do, but by looking at their historical 
experience to see whatever influences such things and whatever is occurring 
in the remainder of the community that will affect that particular commodity. 
They don’t simply order that a certain amount of a commodity be made 
and make the people like it or lump it. They try to determine what the 
people want, as we do, but by a different method. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   They are finding 
it progressively more difficult to transfer the evidences of individual 
accomplishment away from those things that require large expenditures. 
They are going toward large differentiations in purchasing power. They 
have adjusted quickly to pecuniary standards as a criterion of judgment—not 
completely so but toward that—despite their efforts to the contrary. 
Their differences in income are considerable but nothing like ours. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">5-17: The British Kind of Socialism.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">British socialist development 
was very important. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   First, a consideration 
of the Fabians—a group of persons who organized themselves for the 
purpose of what they would call educating the people in Britain for 
socialism. It includes many intellectuals, such as Sydney and Beatrice 
Webb, H.G. Wells, George Bernard Shaw. It has been an important influence 
on British thought and thus on action. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The Fabians keep 
their numbers small. An educational institution, not a political party. 
But they have been active in British politics—active in the campaign 
of 1906, for example, which first brought the Labor Party to power. 
The Labor Party has always, in some sense or other, been socialistically 
inclined. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Evolutionary socialists. 
They have been very mild in their reform proposals for the most part. 
The Webbs, however, are not so mild. A remarkable couple, wealthy, fairly 
radical Marxists—their analysis not entirely Marxist but in large 
part founded upon it. There have been influences other than Marx, however.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   “Wait for the 
moment and then strike hard.” That’s what they did in Britain. Another 
frequently stated maxim in their literature is: “Step  by step.” 
Use research and persuasion. They do this mostly in reference to specific 
problems as they arise. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Present structure 
of Fabian theory is based upon the marginal utility theory of value. 
This leads to Shaw’s position that you have to have equality of income.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Besides the marginal 
utility theory of value, the other basic theory behind the Fabian structure 
is the Henry George theory of rent. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   When they struck, 
they started trying specifically to transfer about 20% of the economy 
to a socialistic structure. They have accomplished most of this, and 
now they are trying to  make it work. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Back to the two 
the two theoretical bases of Fabian socialism:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
1. Marginal utility theory of value.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">       
2. Ricardian theory of rent. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Henry George has 
had more influence in England than in America. He wrote <i>Progress 
and Poverty</i> while trying to figure out the depression that began 
in 1873 (?). The Ricardian rent theory says that as population increases, 
the market’s worth of product decreases as more and more capital and 
labor are applied to land. George goes on: Rent is proportionate to 
the richness of the land. Speculators purchase land and cut off the 
return to labor of higher production. Wages and profits then are reduced. 
Wages are reduced to what can be produced on marginal land, and the 
margin is extended by speculation. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Like Ricardo, 
George points out income coming from the product of land other than 
at the margin becomes rent. It becomes payment for the non-productive 
“participation” in the economic process. So since land is limited 
and differs in fertility, wages must be forced down as poorer land is 
brought into use because wages are the product of the poorest land in 
use. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Again like Ricardo, 
George says that if all the product went to land and capital, society 
would be richer. So George proposes to destroy rent, through the single 
tax on land. Tax the entire differential. This would:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     1. 
Help labor and capital formation by taking away the burden of their 
tax liabilities. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     2. 
Increase productivity by the use of more productive land, which would 
increase the     </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
wealth of the nation in Adam Smith’s terms. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The unearned increment 
that is rent is the product of the community and should not go to individuals. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Ricardo did not 
propose the single tax, but he made it possible for George to do so 
by developing the differential rent theory. Ricardo was no reformist 
as Henry George was. Ricardo didn’t object to rent, but he did object 
to extending the margin.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Then the Fabians 
took off from George and extended the theory to capital as well as land. 
Income from capital is also “unearned.” </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   (George also influenced 
Sun-Yat-Sen.)</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The Fabians in 
England have accomplished actually confiscatory taxation on some things—sometimes 
more than 100% on income from capital assets. Very high inheritance 
taxes. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Henry George was 
an individualist, not a socialist. He wanted to facilitate free private 
enterprise, to further the accumulation of capital equipment, that is, 
both circulating and fixed capital, thus helping both capital and labor. 
The whole community would be better off by virtue of this impetus given 
to private enterprise. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The Fabians extended 
this differential rent theory to all assets, and thus extended George 
into socialism. They maintained that George and Ricardo were in error 
in thinking that capital was productive. Proof of this required a shift 
to the marginal utility theory of value. Here there are two alternatives, 
the neo-classical position and the Fabian position. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   If you use the 
marginal utility theory of value (price theory), there is no distinction 
between land and capital. Money’s worth is all you have. So the Fabians, 
by shifting to marginal utility theory, shifted from capitalism to socialism, 
by taking the only other alternative. So unearned income is that going 
to other than labor.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">5-18:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Fabians deny the distinction 
between land and capital that Ricardo and Henry George make. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Ricardo and George 
distinguish between land and capital on three bases:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     1. 
The distinction between gift and man-creation. Land is a gift of God, 
and capital is </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
created by man. (The Fabians point out that land and capital both produce 
nothing</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
alone; the usefulness of both is as a result of the application of labor.)</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     2. 
Land is limited in area, and capital is not limited in the same sense. 
(The Fabians </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
deny this too, saying that land area is a function of know-how. The 
economic </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
significance of land is not its lineal measurement, not simple area 
but economic use. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
Thus there is no such thing as marginal land. There is such a thing 
as marginal land</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
for particular uses. The Fabians are right about that. The economic 
aspect, not the</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
geographical area, is what you must talk about if you consider land 
as an economic</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
factor.)</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     3. 
There is no cost of production in land, whereas capital involves real 
cost. (And the</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
Fabians disagree on that too. Both have price, so they’re the same 
thing as far as</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
economic price is concerned.)</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Thus, in the opinion 
of the Fabians, the Ricardian theory of rent is quite as applicable 
to <a href="http://capital.as" target="_blank">capital.as</a> to land.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Political aspects 
of Fabian theory:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   First, they insist 
on the democratic process in determining public policy. They do not 
distinguish between the determination of political policy and that of 
economic policy. Thus, they would stand on Locke, Jefferson, Smith, 
and Ricardo that the two processes are inextricably bound together, 
that you cannot have one without the other. Whoever controls the means 
of life controls the political process as well. The Fabians differ as 
to what constitutes the democratic process, differing among themselves 
as well as with the liberals. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The classical 
distinction between land and capital has gone back to Ricardo’s definitions. 
Rent equals payment for the original and indestructible properties of 
the soil. Interest is the same thing—payment for the indestructible 
properties of money. This is disturbing because it is a seeming destruction 
of the rate of interest. The disappearance of the rentier refers both 
to the one who owns land and the one who loans money. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The Fabians disagree 
with this position, holding that land and capital are valuable because 
of developments attained by the community rather than by the individual. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Second, regarding 
the distinction as to the determination of policy, classical theory 
holds that effective demand operates in the market in terms of income. 
“Dollars vote.” It’s a democratic choice. The Fabians say that’s 
right except that it’s the dollar, not the man, that chooses. A man 
who has a million dollars has a million more votes than one who has 
one dollar. It shouldn’t be that way. Each man should have equal voice 
in the determination of the character of production. Capitalism doesn’t 
accomplish this; only socialism does. So representation in both the 
political and the economic processes should be functional rather than 
geographical. Persons have interests not tied to geography. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   There are three 
major groups whose interests may be identified as common to all in the 
group:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     1. 
Consumers.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     2. 
Producers.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     3. 
Citizenship.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   So organization 
must be made in terms of functional relationships rather than in terms 
of point of residence. Provision must be made for democratic representation 
of each of these three groups. And all of these three groups are opposed 
to each other in some senses. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   How can this be 
accomplished? First, separate political from economic affairs, just 
like orthodox economists. Have political government for government of 
people, for defense, justice, etc. Have a second government for the 
government of things, to take care of economic things. The political 
legislature would be based on territorial representation, as now. But 
the economic or social legislature would have discretion over health, 
education, taxation, art, recreation, public services, etc. The representatives 
would be chosen in part territorially--insofar as territory identifies 
an interest, such as ship-building--and in part according to industries. 
Consumers’ and producers’ interests would be cared for by the fact 
that there is no immediate need for complete socialization. You don’t 
disrupt the flow of consumer goods, so you can’t nationalize all at 
once, and when you do nationalize you don’t do it for all of the industry. 
You do it piece by piece and step by step. So they differ with the communists 
on this point. In fact, most Fabians oppose complete socialization. 
Many would retain private management of one-man operations such as farming. 
But you do propose socialization of industries that are on a national 
scale and local socialization of industries on a community scale. They 
differ a little here. Some hold that all production is social and none 
individual.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Another way that 
consumers’ interests are taken care of is through the compulsory establishment 
of consumers’ co-ops. Advantages: they have been successful as owners 
of means of production, more equitable distribution of gains, more adaptable 
to changes in the state of the industrial arts—permit use of new inventions; 
allows greater choice and freedom in occupation, etc., allows greater 
choice in the character of consumption. Point out that consumer co-ops 
cannot be allowed full power. The problem of comparative costs vs. comparative 
wants. Propose to control this matter by setting up unions and professional 
organizations. Generally agreed on setting up groups organized in terms 
of identity along with those in terms of geographical identity. The 
functional groups would set limits to the success to which any efforts 
would be made to eventuate consumer demands (?). </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   They claim several 
things for these unions. One, it will result in an improvement in the 
conditions of work. Two, it will improve the dignity and character of 
workers. Three, it will provide a very ready institutional device for 
securing cooperation. Four, it will improve the rate of invention and 
development by permitting interchange of ideas and ready access to improvements. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   For reasons of 
this kind, they would say that consumers should control quantity, quality, 
and price, through the democratic process, and that producers should 
control wages, hours, etc. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   This kind of analysis 
has had a great deal of effect in Britain, considerable effect in New 
Zealand and Australia, and some in Canada.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">5-19:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Financial arrangements and 
some of the industries that have been nationalized in Britain. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The first thing 
nationalized was the Bank of England, which had been a private company 
since its charter but which had become closely allied with the government. 
Thus the nationalization didn’t involve any dislocation or reorganization. 
The Bank has always been a very remunerative enterprise—the stockholders 
had been receiving about 12%. They paid 4% on the bonds and paid the 
stockholders well too, following the British technique of paying for 
everything and paying well and then taking away most of it in taxes. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   However, the adjustments 
they tried have not been restricted to socialism. Trying to meet investment 
is a necessity for the British. The two major devices for promoting 
investment were set up by the conservative government. (In our own country 
we have tried to meet the investment problem through the Reconstruction 
Finance Corporation, the Federal Land Bank, etc., not too differently 
from what Britain has done.) In Britain, as here, the provision of funds 
for investment has been a problem. Britain has set up two major institutions: 
(1) the Finance Corporation for Industry, which makes loans above 200,000 
pounds, and (2) the Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation, which 
makes loans of less than 200,000 pounds. They have a committee, the 
Treasury Committee, to approve loans comparable to the Securities and 
Exchange Commission in the U.S., which passes on new issues that are 
to be raised in the open market. In Britain the committee passes on 
all issues. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The British also 
have a National Investment Council, which advises the other institutions, 
especially the Treasury Committee. This is a connecting link between 
the official administration of the government and the committee. After 
it is determined that a new issue shall be granted, the enterprise can 
sell securities in the open market. The two corporations for investment 
can furnish funds if they think the investment sound. The law of ’45 
permits also a guarantee of private loans. This permits bankers to make 
a living.      </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Britain has attempted 
through this structure to apply Keynesian theory to investment. They 
have tried to use productive factors to the fullest extent. But they 
have had other problems. In taking over the coal industry, for example, 
they have had a continuing process of adjustment. Socialization of coal 
mines has been going on for about thirty years. The mines got in bad 
shape during the First World War and deteriorated between the wars. 
The depression accentuated the difficulties.  Low wages made miners 
bitter and rebellious. Coal to Britain is fundamental, the basic resource 
in British industry. Production fell off per unit of labor. That continued 
throughout the Second World War. The government claims to have reversed 
it in the last two years, but the figures aren’t very clear on it. 
So the shift was not a sudden one from free private enterprise to government 
ownership. The conservative government started it. A commission was 
appointed to study coal mines, and in 1919 the chairman recommended 
government ownership. (This was sort of similar to developments in the 
U.S. as to railroads. It was recognized that something had to be done.) 
The commission recommended that the government fix up the mines and 
give them back to the owners, as we did the railroads. By 1924 under 
that arrangement conditions had become so bad that the miners were threatening 
revolt. So the government subsidized wages. In 1927 they took the subsidy 
away and there was a terrific strike, which just about starved the people 
to death. The miners gave in, but they didn’t like it. They went to 
work in line with the American miners, who were under the leadership 
of John L. Lewis. In 1930 another committee was appointed, the Coal 
Reorganization Committee, with the purpose of encouraging reorganization 
for greater efficiency. They got some things done; they convinced some 
coal operators that through certain collaborative arrangements they 
could reduce the cost of coal.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   In 1938 the Act 
Nationalizing Coal Resources was passed, in which coal resources were 
taken in title by the community but the mines remained in private ownership 
and control. The operators were to operate them in the public interest. 
Those who owned and operated the mines no longer received dividends 
but got government stock instead. They were paid an amount fifteen times 
the average earnings they had been receiving over a period of twenty 
years. So they received interest on government bonds, and the government 
got the returns from the resources. It was an interesting attempt to 
solve the problem. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Then a year after 
the war was over they took over the mines under the Coal Nationalization 
Act of 1946. The act requires that the industry as a whole gain from 
the market average unit costs. Now about half of the mines are below 
and about half above. The labor government points out that under private 
ownership half of the mines would be left out of operation. The conservative 
element replies that without government interference costs would be 
reduced and prices would go up enough to pay the costs. The labor government 
replies that coal production would go down and that some miners would 
be unemployed. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   They have in fact 
raised coal production above its pre-war level, and with less labor. 
Of course many factors are involved. The coal problem is a test case. 
If they succeed with it, it will be a big boost for the socialist government. 
They are paying a lot of attention to the coal mines. They can do things 
such as increasing user costs without accounting it on the books, just 
as we did in lumbering.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The problem of 
meeting average unit costs in the coal industry has worried British 
economists a great deal. It must show success. So the opposition has 
accused the government of pushing socialization faster than they would 
if they didn’t feel it necessary to socialize as extensively as possible 
for political reasons in case the coal thing doesn’t   succeed.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   All in all, it 
would appear that the government is pretty successful. But there is 
controversy. Many of the miners feel that the American system has been 
better for the miners.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   One problem is 
what to do with the stuff that eventuates from the production of coal, 
such as steel. There is the problem of exportation. We’re forcing 
them to trade with Russia and forbidding them at the same time. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">5-20:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Science is not an ism. It is 
a method, a process. Democracy likewise….When we cannot predict, it 
is because we do not have applicable theory. If the theory is right, 
we can predict—in <i>any </i>area. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Back to the structure 
of the British institutions having to do with the coal industry. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Coal mining has 
come to be a symbol of socialization.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The problem of 
the international balance of trade has come to focus in a way that is 
holding up before the world a criterion by which the Labor Party and 
its program (theory) can be judged. That problem is connected with the 
coal industry in this fashion: Britain has to trade internationally 
in order to live, and the diversity of her trade is spelled out by the 
degree to which she has developed specialization. She has furnished 
the world with international trade theory. Classical economic theory 
grew out of it. Ricardian theory won the day, and Britain entered an 
era of free trade. She gathered great wealth through titles to foreign 
assets. She did this be selling more than she bought, with the difference 
taken in foreign titles. She was for a long time in the stage of mercantilism. 
It seemed clear that she had gained by having a favorable balance of 
trade. Along with that went the development of her Empire. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   After the turn 
of the century, that theory was brought into question. Does a favorable 
balance of trade in fact increase the wealth of the nation? The U.S. 
went into the First World War the greatest debtor nation in the world 
and came out of it the greatest creditor nation. War debts changed that 
situation. The U.S. has had a favorable balance of trade every year 
since 1891.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   After the First 
World War, outlets for investment funds brought about such changes as 
we indicated in connection with the Bank of England. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Is it automatic 
for a favorable balance of trade to bring real wealth? Maybe Britain 
became wealthy on other grounds.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The socialists 
took the position that a favorable balance of trade is not advantageous. 
They apply that in socialistic theory. Now Britain has begun to try 
to get rid of her Empire, whereas before she thought she had to have 
it to live. Now the government says Britain can’t afford the Empire. 
An unfavorable balance is favorable. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The difference 
between the orthodox classicists and the socialists is this. The real 
wealth of a nation is goods and services, so if you ship out more than 
you take in you decrease the wealth of the nation. Taking titles is 
just a means of kidding yourself. It may be that the goods you ship 
out are some you can’t use at home, which is another problem. There 
are two general international trade problems: (1) the exchange of goods 
and services for goods and services, and (2) the exchange of goods and 
services for capital assets. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">5-23:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Peculiarities 
of the American Economy.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We’ll look at feudalism first. 
It is characterized by a specification of function and position in the 
economy on the basis of birth (on the basis of family). Its importance 
is due not to the fact that any important economies are based on it 
but rather to the fact that it still pervades other isms. It is very 
apparent in our own economy, for example, as in the family. We inherit 
wealth and in some sense inherit occupation. Education is left in large 
measure to the parents. We inherit their name. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   But since the 
destruction of the Japanese economy in the last war there is no major 
economy that we could fairly characterize as feudalistic. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Communists object 
to the family because they think of it as a feudal structure. But now 
they’re fitting it into their structure.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The American kind 
of thinking is a little difficult to put your finger on. We are noticeably 
ism-ridden, but perhaps less so than any other community in the history 
of the world, according to Carl Becker. Foster thinks perhaps he is 
right.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   American historical 
experience has been different. Social scientists derive from this the 
notion that a peculiar pattern of thought cannot be compared with another 
pattern, that it comes from the cultural heritage of the group. This 
way of thinking is unfortunate. Institutions <i>can </i>
be compared, and they can be thought of as desirable or undesirable 
in other terms than of a particular culture. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   We ordinarily 
think of our system as capitalistic, and it is. The American heritage 
is European, where capitalism developed. But Americans have had a peculiar 
experience, and they have come out with unique institutions as a result 
of it. We’ll focus on these differences, remembering that our heritage 
is primarily European. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The European culture 
didn’t fit the American pattern very well when the Europeans first 
came over here. But they began to learn how to get along. Up until about 
the turn of this century there was a frontier, in the sense that there 
were natural resources outside of the market process. (You didn’t 
have to pay for them; you could get them by just going to work on them.) 
They went across the country that way. And the frontier shaped the institutions. 
Most of our ancestors were European political prisoners.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The ones who set 
the original pattern in each community for three centuries were frontiersmen. 
There is probably no parallel instance of this in the history of the 
world. The mores and the folkways were modified for three hundred years 
by the experience of the frontier. The idea of cooperation and mutual 
responsibility is a peculiarity of the frontier. Rugged individualism 
isn’t a characteristic of the frontiersman. He developed new attitudes, 
new habits, new abilities. There was a lack of respect for law and for 
the policeman. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   There have always 
been Americans who were aware of this situation—European culture and 
American pattern: Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, etc. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Along about the 
last half of the nineteenth century, when we sort of began to be conscious 
of ourselves, we began to try to express it in theoretical form. The 
central body of American theoretical analysis has been European—classical 
theory. That theory found its application in the American colonies. 
But always there were peculiarly American heterodoxies. Henry George 
was an offshoot, but he never had much effect in America. The American 
contribution to economic theory has sprung in most part from Thorstein 
Veblen. Out of that you find what characterizes the U.S., both in terms 
of theory and in terms of structure. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The Veblen revolt 
was against classical theory. Americans had always been in revolt against 
it, although they always talked vehemently for it. Their experience 
hadn’t fitted the classical theory. They had been peculiarly scientific. 
Their problems had been constantly matters of life and death. By virtue 
of the length of this period, they considered economic matters very 
important, as matters of life and death, not just power and prestige. 
So Veblen found a responsive chord in America when he attacked classical 
theory. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   He attacked the 
received doctrine on several bases: One, it is tautological. You have 
to make assumptions that generate your conclusions before you can make 
the analysis by which you arrive at the conclusions. Two, it is teleological. 
The economy has direction in the sense that it has an ultimate end at 
which it is to arrive in the sense of a consciously built structure. 
The “unseen hand” idea of Adam Smith. If you don’t interfere with 
the process, it goes on of its own accord toward its established end. 
In nature, there are cause-and-effect sequences. Not in classical theory. 
The validation of institutions is that they give direction on the established 
track. Institutions, then, are sort of intentional, natural. Veblen 
says they’re not. Man intentionally directs the path of institutions. 
It doesn’t happen by virtue of guidance outside of man. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">5-24:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The peculiarity of the American 
contribution to economic theory hinges on the theory of value. Americans 
have talked like other people, ismatically, because that was all that 
was available. But they haven’t acted that way. They’re the least 
legalistically minded people in the world. That is because they have 
confronted problems that couldn’t be solved in terms of an ism; problems 
have been continuously such that survival depended upon application 
of other than ismatic theory. In other communities it was not quite 
so serious—application of ismatic theory did not so frequently mean 
failure to survive, although it did mean a low standard of living. So 
the American people have created all kinds of institutions that have 
no relationship to the ism that is being applied. So Americans are most 
frequently termed as uncultured by Europeans. We have created public 
utilities, which don’t fit any of the isms. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Americans are 
peculiar in that respect. We have come out with a lot of idiotic behavior. 
We have persisted in acting one way and talking another. But we have 
been forced to act instrumentally. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   So what is the 
American system? Where possible we keep it ceremonially adequate in 
the capitalistic sense. We make those who use the highways pay for them. 
That makes it just. But when it won’t work, we provide something else. 
Flood control, for example.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Americans have 
insisted on institutional adjustment where it was necessary to solve 
a problem, irrespective of the ism, to a peculiar degree.  Not 
because we are wiser, but because of our experience. We’re peculiarly 
unbound. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   And along with 
this kind of behavior came an articulation of it, which is the only 
peculiarly American contribution to economic thought. Institutionalism—Thorstein 
Veblen. There was considerable consternation: here was a man talking 
as if isms weren’t very important. But he was fairly well received 
for several reasons. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   One, there were 
enough mature scholars to sort of appreciate what he was saying. Two, 
he wrote in such an erudite fashion that it was a matter of prestige 
to have read him—a demonstration of the capacity to waste. Of course 
Veblen was having fun, but he also had something to say. One thing he 
had to say was a criticism of the classical analysis.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   As noted above, 
Veblen attacked the classical, actually now also the neo-classical, 
analysis on the ground that, one, it was tautological. Two, it was teleological. 
This was, incidentally, true also of Marxian, Fabian, and any other 
kind of ismatic economic analysis. That is to say, it involved an assumption 
of intelligently directed movement in the economy, which means that 
a realignment of the determining factors must be outside the process 
itself. An animistic preconception. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Three, Veblen 
attacked the concept of the “economic man.” This has been and is 
conceived in terms of the hedonistic calculus. There are two stages 
of hedonism. The first stage--early economic theory parallel to the 
accepted philosophy of the time—was called primitive hedonism or Benthamism. 
Using the two Mills as an example, James Mill had an associational psychology 
on the basis of contiguousness. In the second stage, hedonism was used 
as the basis for conceptual association, which had been changed from 
contiguity to similarity. Note that these are the two stages of development 
of utilitarian theory. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The first stage 
involves regarding man as a sort of passive agent—like John Locke 
and the Utopian socialists. But with the similarity basis man becomes 
an active agent. So by the time of Marshall the shift was pretty well 
made to man being the directing agent. This is still accepted today.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Costs are not 
real according to Veblen, but reciprocal. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   But in either 
stage of hedonism, man using reason is the same, and the same answers 
are obtained for the same problems. This psychology dictates the character 
of the theory. And that theory of human nature had been, by Veblen’s 
time, washed out to sea. Veblen said man’s behavior is determined 
by the mores principle. People act customarily. What they like is a 
matter of what they learn to like. If you take wants as given data, 
you are in the position of judging what man likes by what he likes. 
A nice pastime, but it won’t solve problems. </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">5-25:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The theory of value is stressed 
in the social sciences because the criterion of judgment determines 
the character of the answers in any choices between alternatives. So 
economics is essentially a science of the theory of value. The shift 
from the labor theory to price theories of valuation has resulted in 
a virtual identification of price and value. The neo-classical position 
is that price is the only evidence we have of value. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   What theory of 
valuation goes along with the instrumental efficiency theory of value?  
We have no single unit of measurement. The unit of measurement is different 
for different commodities. Ergo, for example, measuring energy. We also 
have no unit in which we can measure the value of a telescope. One’s 
own experience can be used in identifying the locus of value in the 
instrumental efficiency theory. Instrumental efficiency is distinguishable 
from ceremonial efficiency. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   In some problems 
you can “get by” by using other than the instrumental efficiency 
theory of value, but in problems in the area of the economic process 
you can’t “get by.”</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Disraeli said 
that being practical is continuing in the mistakes of our ancestors. 
This is a significant idea. We are admonished to be practical, not to 
be idealistic and try to make progress. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The peculiarity 
of the American experience is probably best summed up in the experience 
of the frontier. That, plus the fact that we’re still close to it, 
plus the change in the industrial arts, distinguishes us as Americans—makes 
us what we are. We had to solve problems instrumentally instead of ceremoniously, 
not that we didn’t try the latter. So we have developed a “mixed 
economy” more than another. Our mixed economy is not a mixture of 
isms but means that we have invented a bunch of institutions. We have 
found that the isms won’t solve problems, but we haven’t admitted 
it yet, partly because we haven’t the words for it. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Veblen tried to 
put this kind of experience into words. He wrote books in which he tried 
to set forth a theory. First, he learned all there was to know. He accomplished 
this to an amazing degree. Then he tried to make some sense out of it. 
He decided that the kind of theory we have had won’t solve our problems. 
The reason is that we don’t understand the difference between technology 
and institutions. The physical means of life determine the character 
of experience, and it becomes institutionalized through “gradual, 
cumulative, and unconscious habituation.” Persons act habitually; 
“economic man” does not exist. Man acts a certain way because he 
learned to act that way, not because of his reason.  Man changes 
his actions because of changes in technology, not through reason. What 
we mean by the Veblenian distinction is the distinction between technology 
and institutions. He confused the constitution of an institution (a 
pattern of habits) with the determination of an institution. They are 
not the same thing. Nevertheless, he did some important things with 
his distinction. An example of his contribution is his work on <i>The 
Nature of Peace and the Terms of Its Perpetuation.</i>, a very cogent 
book. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Veblen thought 
that institutions and technology are independently progressive. Neither 
depended upon the other. Institutions come into being through habituation, 
and they change with something of a consistent sequence. He didn’t 
know just what this sequence was, he said, but some of his students 
should find out, <i>i.e.</i>, write a theory of history. He thought 
it was economic in character. Men don’t act very rationally when confronted 
with a problem they have to solve, but proceed more or less by trial 
and error. The received doctrine is not true and is also beside the 
point. Economic analysis is pre-Darwinian, by which he meant pre-outside-of-the-process 
directional. Darwin found no direction in the development of the physical 
species. Veblen found no direction in the development of institutions. 
All we can do is identify direction in terms of process. It is in terms 
not of an approach to a particular institutional pattern, but direction 
in terms of greater economy and efficiency. He was thinking of instrumental 
efficiency but didn’t know it because he didn’t know about the significance 
of science. He thought that scientific investigation was due to idle 
curiosity, and he couldn’t validate it. Individual scientists probably 
do in fact proceed because of idle curiosity, but that does not mean 
that science is not significant. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Veblen is perplexing 
because we can’t find out what kind of philosophy he is applying, 
and he couldn’t find out either. He thought that maybe his efforts 
were at bottom without significance. Perhaps thus the irony in his writing.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   He said that the 
theory we’ve got to have of the social process (and especially the 
economic process) has to take the form of a life history of mankind 
drawn in causal terms. It has to explain behavior in terms of institutions. 
How explain institutions? Fill in “the warp and the woof” of their 
development. That’s the only we can find answers to economic problems. 
Insofar as there are “real” answers, they are found that way. Veblen 
examined Germany in the light of institutions and technology and was 
able to describe and predict what would happen. He used his premise 
that technology modifies institutions. With the little bit that he had 
he was able to predict what he did. [Me: i.e. predict World War II.]</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Of one thing he 
was certain: what you’ve got to begin with is the facts. And he convinced 
his students of that. What he meant is that you’ve got to apply a 
theory to the facts. But he didn’t really know it and didn’t say 
so. But all of his students are still counting. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   What Veblen was 
setting up is what the American people have been doing. They have always 
had a suspicion of the Veblenian distinction. But they never knew how 
to talk about it. The American system is what Veblen was talking about. 
The failure of the American social scientists has resulted in a lot 
of idiotic talk, such as, “Let’s throw out this theory and be practical.” 
They discredited theory. Now the social scientists have available to 
them the correct theory. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">5-26:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We regulate all economic enterprise. 
There is no such thing as “free private enterprise.” But we use 
that term to refer to something that does exist—a privately owned 
enterprise that is not regulated as to price and service. Public utilities <i>
are </i>regulated as to price and service. Public utility regulating 
bodies violate the law every day. They have to in order to perform their 
function. We have provided no theory by which the ICC, for example, 
can determine rates and service. They do have a pattern, but it is not 
that specified by law. They don’t use the idea of “a fair return 
on a fair evaluation,” which is the rule specified. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   In British law 
a public utility is an uneconomic organization and can’t be regulated; 
in ours it is an economic organization and is regulated, and not too 
badly.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   In our system 
the persons who set up the rules for the regulation of public utilities 
are not the ones who have to solve the problem. That makes it difficult.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Public utilities 
are not the only institutions we have set up in areas where we needed 
institutions that don’t fit any ism. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Some social scientists 
have come to hold that there is supposed to be a discrepancy between 
fact and theory. The physicists know better—they got over that a long 
time ago. Social scientists sometimes say that we’re supposed to confront 
paradoxes; we have always acted in terms of paradoxes.</font> <br>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">5-27:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Continuation of peculiarities 
in the American economy, both in structure and in theory. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The American contribution 
has been an attack on the problem involved in solving actual economic 
problems. So such men as Thorstein Veblen, J.M. Clark, John R. Commons, 
and C.E. Ayres are trying to get at the continuing factors in the economic 
process. Veblen started it and made it possible for some of his better 
students, Handman and C.E. Ayres, to continue with the theory. They 
were able to discern where you have to look to identify the locus of 
value. The present stage of the theory has taken only two forms: </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     1. 
A recognition of incompletion and hence a searching out.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     2. 
A theory of common consent as a criterion of judgment, especially at 
the hands of</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
of Commons.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Institutionalism 
is then in effect a disclaimer of the possibility of a theory of value.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Veblen’s less 
discerning students objected to Veblen’s presentation by saying that 
“it isn’t going anywhere.” That’s the fault of institutionalists. 
Veblen said, that’s right, it <i>isn’t </i>
 going anywhere. There is no given pattern of institutions toward which 
to work. But “where” can be identified in terms other than structure. 
The institutionalists lost our here. They think of :”where” as being 
an institutional structure. So they slipped back to pre-Veblenian theory 
and into the classical groove. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Unfortunately 
the American contributors have stayed behind the theory they tried to 
advance instead of serving as guides. Now they’re doing a little better.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   So the American 
economy has all kinds of institutional structures, which can’t be 
identified in terms of each other. We are thus less inclined to try 
to solve problems in terms of an ism. When we hit problems that arise 
out of other problems, we don’t know quite what to do. Foreign policy 
is an example. We don’t have a theory, so we act rather ridiculously. 
So Americans, more than any other people, say, “Let’s be practical.” 
They mean by this something different than the British—they mean, 
“Let’s really solve the problem.” </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   There are several 
major problems.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   One is the level 
of employment. The community has solved the problem tolerably by consciously 
trying to apply Keynesian theory. It hasn’t worked perfectly, so we 
have tended to think that his theory wouldn’t solve the problem. We’re 
right, in that his theory alone isn’t enough. When we hit the war, 
when we really had to <i>produce</i>, we said, “To heck with Keynesian 
theory.” We made arrangements with entrepreneurs to produce what we 
needed—just as we did in the First World War. We didn’t likek it 
because it made so many people rich, but we used that plan because it 
produced the goods. Industry raised costs to increase income whether 
it raised production or not. So we hit the problem of maintaining a 
pattern of distribution, about which all we could think of to do was 
to raise income taxes in higher brackets. We have found no effective 
way in which to bring about a just distribution of income. We don’t 
know how to increase money wages without making real wages go down. 
We recognize it as a major problem, especially in war, but we haven’t 
solved it. We don’t have the required institutional arrangements, 
although we have all kinds. We invent them in terms of “expediency.” 
So we have a great many institutional inventions—a very “mixed economy.” 
But this problem of the level of employment has not yet been solved, 
although the solution is now largely in view. It is a matter of the 
relationship between monopoly and the level of employment. An increase 
in effective demand does not necessarily result in increased demand 
for the factors, as Keynes assumed.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   There is confusion 
in our thinking about competition and monopoly. The Supreme Court sometimes 
enforces competition, and it sometimes prohibits competition. They don’t 
know what theory they’re applying. They try to apply orthodox economic 
theory, but can’t. Whenever the goods aren’t being hauled, the decision 
is made that will permit them to be hauled—under whatever arrangements, 
monopolistic or competitive. In terms of “How much?” That’s the 
way we’ve operated. Now we don’t want to do that anymore. It is 
tied up with the problem of the level of employment. We know enough 
about depression now so that we can prevent it. And we’re now in a 
situation where we have to work out the theory—the time element in 
the international situation is too short. We’ve got to develop that 
theory. And the peculiar mixture of our economy is a fortunate circumstance 
in our background. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   An aside by Foster 
in answer to a question: The size of debt is of no concern. What is 
of concern is the <i>rate of increase</i> of debt…. We discovered 
that the Keynesian theory had limitations in terms of the level of employment. 
During the war we controlled inflation the best we could, through rationing, 
appeals to voluntary savings, controls of credit, etc. We <i>had </i>
to: the M Point. Keynesian theory told us how to get up to it in the 
level of employment but not beyond. The community still doesn’t know 
what to do. So we accept sixty million as full employment, but estimates 
have been made that ninety-five million would be willing to work if 
we set up arrangements that would make it possible. There is a tremendous 
potential increase in output. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   How much unemployment 
would we as a community tolerate? Maybe four to six million. Then what 
would we do? We don’t know. But we would do some things that we can 
see, such as change the arrangements we have for providing housing. </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">John R. Commons. He has had 
much influence on the structure of American economic institutions.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   He set up five 
principles of explanation to determine what he called transactions. 
His notion was that economic affairs proceed through intellectual intercourse 
and in some sense through agreement, what he called transactions. He 
was looking toward what Veblen had called the quest for the determination 
of institutions. Example: price variation. Even that occurs as some 
sort of transaction between persons.  He set out to find the continuing 
factors and found, from Veblen, that they couldn’t be found in an 
institutional structure. They had to be found in terms of process. But 
he didn’t hold to this very well in his continuing factors. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Commons recently 
retired from the University of Wisconsin. He did heavyweight thinking 
for the elder Mr. LaFollette. They formed a sort of team in Wisconsin—remade 
the government and the University of Wisconsin and did a lot of other 
things. Commons constantly refused to assume administrative duties in 
order to pursue his studies. He had an impact on students. They came 
out with a sort of disdain for theoretical stuff, and yet Commons was 
trying to make sense out of theory. But he imbued his students with 
the idea of beginning with the facts, as Veblen had done to him. He 
did try to get theory straight. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The five principles 
that constitute the way you should explain how the economy proceeds:</font></p>

Efficiency. (Some persons have come to call this decision-making.) What

output per unit of input. He thought of it in terms of process. He never 
was quite</font></p>

that because</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">         
of Veblen’s fatal attack on it. But he did think it was determined 
by the </font></p>

technological aspect of management—use-value in engineering terms. 
He couldn’t</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">

none. He thought that there could be no organized theory. He thought 
that when you tried to make social theory scientific it became unscientific.

together. That’s what’s wrong with theory, according to Commons.</font></p>

expectations—</font></p>

a comprehension of what is to happen. Contracts themselves are a specification

took power they had the problem of already having built up a favorable 
balance of trade. All of Britain’s arrangements were made in those 
terms. They have the problem of making market arrangements and connections 
that will permit them to bring in both goods and foreign assets. They’re 
having considerable trouble. So it seems that the British government 
is rather naïve in international affairs. The socialist theory is really 
that of a closed economy. And economies in the world are various. She 
doesn’t know how to get rid of her goods and acquire the goods she 
needs from a variety of economies. One, she has decided to make arrangements 
for the export dumping necessity. Two, she also has to make arrangements 
to get goods for what she produces. She thinks she has taken care of 
the first, but she can’t solve the second. So we have the peculiar 
anomaly of the British internally acting like socialists and externally 
like money-grabbers, as they have for centuries. So they are selling 
automobiles in the U.S. to get dollars to buy goods in an unfavorable

bothered by the distinction between induction and deduction, sort of 
paralleled by the distinction between theory and practice. He says he 
sought a balance between the two, “Passing back and forth between 
hypothesis and observation, each modifying and enriching the other.” 
Theory is to “create order amidst the confused facts of observation.” 
This can be done by statistics. He uses statistical norms, such as arithmetic 
mean, modal average, geometric mean, etc. Economics will be less concerned 
with puzzles about economic motives and more concerned with the objective 
validity of the account it gives to economic process, says Mitchell. 
But are not motives a part of the economic process? (Foster)</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Mitchell made 
a distinction between practice and theory in some sense in which it 
is not usually made. The “’passing back and forth” between hypothesis 
and observation is what does in fact happen in scientific analysis. 
But how can you give an objective account of something without considering 
motives, when motives determine the thing you’re trying to give an 
account of?  If economics is not a social but a physical science, if 
human beings do not use discretion, if economics is not an institutional 
science, then Mitchell’s distinction is valid. But if economics is 
a social science, and all the rest, his distinction blocks his entire 
analysis. His confusion is that which is prevalent in our thinking. 
Out of this has come the notion that there can be no science of social 
analysis, that social “science” is, rather, an “art.” Mitchell 
thought that economics is a science but that its analysis had to be 
restricted to an analytical description of “the run of the facts,” 
not to motives. But what is this explanation, this analytical description, 
this theory, if it excludes motives? It seems that he has an analytical 
analysis that denies analysis. He did work very well, however. And in 
his main field of interest, the business cycle, his theory described 
human motives. His was an eclectic theory of the business cycle. It 
is usually said to be that there is no one cause of depressions, that 
you have to look everywhere. Combine that with his quantitative methodology, 
and you get something like Mitchell. Then when you get to the explanation 
of the economic process, you can reject the orthodox view of how decisions 
are made, but you reach the difficulty of explaining how decisions are 
made without a motive, or not purposefully. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Mitchell objected 
to qualitative analysis. He set up statistical measures. But he pointed 
out that the statisticians can get just as far out of touch with reality, 
just as abstract, as the speculators who formulated orthodox economic 
theory. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   “Quantitative 
Analysis in Economic Theory,” 1925. [Book or article?] He has elaborated 
this theory ever since. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   He tried to identify 
the scope of economics. The distinction between evolution and systematic 
economics. He said Veblen was a little off; you have to have both. They 
should supplement each other. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Economics is concerned 
with four kinds of inquiry:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">        
1, The continuous process of providing and using commodities and services. 
He </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">            
probably had in mind the making of goods--production.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">        
2. The making and spending of money. Everything from family budgets 
to high</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">            
finance. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">        
3. Personal interests, by which he meant “dim inner realm of consciousness.” 
That</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">            
of course is to exclude motives, but it would seem to include them. 
He probably</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">            
meant expressed interests common to a number of persons affecting their</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">            
behavior in the determination of the character of production.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">        
4. Serviceability to the community, rather than individual advantage, 
etc.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   These four inquiries 
are brought into order through money. It is the fact of money that permits 
us to make scientific analysis of them. It forces man to be rational. 
He is forced to make decisions that are calculable. What Mitchell is 
assuming is the seeking of one’s own advantage. Then you can look 
at the inequality of strength and direction of these decisions. Money 
makes this possible, giving a common denominator, a way of estimating 
operations that cannot themselves be looked at. </font> <br> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">6-3:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mitchell is right in thinking 
that we have to work with the pecuniary accountancy. It is the most 
fortunate thing we have. The difficulty is in associating pecuniary 
worth with real value. Mitchell tried for forty years to find a say 
to determine net national product. He criticized neo-classical theory 
in Veblenian terms—tautological, teleological, etc. But he never got 
to what was blocking him, the price theory of valuation. He knew there 
was something wrong with it, but didn’t know what to use instead. 
Keynes met the same problem and couldn’t solve it.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Neither Mitchell 
nor Veblen ever worked out the theory of value, although Veblen showed 
where you have to look for it. Ayres was the first to work it out in 
anything like a definitive form. But Mitchell couldn’t even read Ayres. 
He had the same trouble as the rest of us. He couldn’t free himself 
from initial preconceptions. He couldn’t work out the place of price 
theory in the economic process. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The Russians use 
a pecuniary accountancy as a tool in the economic process. They don’t 
have to make decisions in response to effective demand; they arrange 
effective demand in response to decisions. We do the opposite. However, 
they do investigate demand (changes in fashion, etc.) in order to make 
decisions. But we determine demand by looking at the market, which they 
don’t do--ostensibly. In the last analysis, however, they have to 
look at the market just as we do. In the U.S. the anticipation is ahead 
of the eventuation. In Russia it is the other way around. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Mitchell became 
increasingly concerned with finding a way of positivizing the normative 
aspects of pondering the imponderables. What is the distinction between 
the normative and the positive? Foster: there isn’t any.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The U.S. is less 
ismatic than any other economy; more nearly mixed than any other. Also 
in the U.S. there has been developed, to the greatest extent of anywhere 
in the world, the technique (in the technological sense) of carrying 
on the economy. Our trouble has been in the institutional area, as has 
been the trouble in nearly all economies. The Russians try to use the 
same engineering techniques that we do. That aspect of the process does 
not give different economies much trouble. The problems arise the same 
way in all economies (that is, economic problems arise the same way). 
In carrying on the process in technological terms we have frequently 
found, as have the Russians, etc., that our institutional arrangements 
were not the most effective to permit the use of the technology we have 
attained. The Harvard School of Business decided to look into this to 
find out why people don’t act the way they “should” to maximize 
production. They discovered their assumptions, their “unconscious 
tools,” might be faulty. They found out that paying attention to the 
workers—the prestige element--increased production, so that experiments 
on music, light, rest periods, vacations, etc., weren’t valid. Prestige 
was the most important single principle in employer-employee relationships. 
But you can’t kid the workers about it.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   This holds in 
communism, capitalism, and any ism. The Russians recognized it, as we 
do, and decided to make technological accomplishment real economic value, 
regardless of pecuniary valuation. That involved knowing how to measure 
economic worth. A very big question. Labor content is no basis for such 
a judgment—which the Russians found out pretty quickly. They use the 
same basis as we do: they see what people will buy. They get an opinion 
poll. So we do the same thing as they, but they praise communism and 
we praise capitalism. They found that they couldn’t make people want 
what they “should” want. We haven’t found out yet—much—because 
we are so productive we can spend a great deal (forty percent) on advertising 
without noticing it much. How can this problem be solved? Both Russia 
and the U.S. are using the utility theory of value.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">6-6:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Comparison of isms. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Common features of different 
isms:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   First, the kinds 
of processes carried on in the economic isms are determined by the state 
of the industrial arts. It also determines primarily the ratio between 
the size of the optimum plant and the size of the market in a distributive 
economy and the pattern in a socialistic economy. And that is both geographical 
and biological. Such things as the state of transportation decide the 
distribution of corn. Before railroads, two days’ journey was the 
limit—about fifty miles. Beyond that it cost more to haul it than 
to raise it. Now we haul it all over, but we still can’t haul it more 
than two days’ journey to the railroad. It’s the same in Russia 
as in the U.S.—dictated by the state of the industrial arts, regardless 
of the ism. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Second, also on 
the institutional side, communities are coerced in the direction of 
using those institutional arrangements the product of which is determined 
by the state of the arts in the industrial sense. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Inheritance is 
not capitalistic; it is feudalistic. Yet many insist that it is peculiar 
to capitalism. In any case, the most liberal capitalists insist that 
we should do away with inheritance. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   So both technologically 
and institutionally the forces are in the direction of compelling the 
most efficient use of the factors at hand. But the fact that people 
believe in isms and in the theoretical validation of isms has a terrific 
effect on the institutions. We have never developed the habit of thinking 
scientifically about economic problems. There is thus a distinction 
between a structure and an ism. A structure is an institution—a way 
of acting; an ism is a belief. We still think ismatically. We are in 
the alchemy stage of chemistry.  We, like the alchemists, have gathered 
a lot of data. We have discovered that when we put certain things together, 
certain other things happen, whether we like it or not. The economist 
is held in some repute, not because he knows how to solve economic problems 
but because if he doesn’t no one does. The man in the street knows 
when problems are not solved. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   All economies 
are of necessity mixed. The economic process can be conceived of as 
a mixture only by virtue of isms. In terms of technology there is only 
one criterion of judgment. In this sense no economy is mixed. There 
are economies that are more or less efficient. Sooner or later almost 
every institutional device comes to be associated with a particular 
ism, but when you get down to its economic functions it is no more one 
ism than another. Some institutions are identifiable in terms of ism; 
others are not. When we get to the chemistry stage of chemistry the 
isms will disappear. There will be no schools of economics just as there 
are no schools of chemistry. Chemistry is the same in Germany as in 
North Dakota. Economics in the scientific sense is also.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">6-8:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Fundamentally all of the problems 
of different economies are the same—in a technological sense. But 
the institutional phases are the ones that concern economists; we leave 
the technological problems to the engineers. Everyone of necessity is 
concerned with the institutional aspects because everyone is a part 
of institutions. Everyone is concerned with technological problems also 
but only in the sense that he must choose the persons best qualified 
to do the job at hand.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   When we try to 
solve an economic problem we are trying to arrange the institutions 
so that we can make optimum use of the factors of production. The capitalists 
try to do that; so do the communists. But all economies are of necessity 
mixed. The criterion of judgment lies in the provision of the actual 
means. The problem takes two shapes—or there are two economic problems: 
(1) the character of the means of life: and (2) the quantity of the 
means of life. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   In consideration 
of those two problems we have habitually thought of the actual provision 
of the means of life as coming out of the ism. Our newspapers, for example, 
say that our progress is a result of capitalism. The Russians say even 
more loudly that their progress is a result of communism. Fascists likewise. 
All isms are teleological. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   We have got isms 
all mixed up with other things, such as democracy. Many think that capitalism 
and democracy are interchangeable. But capitalism can exist under an 
absolute monarchy, and it has done so. Democracy and an ism are not 
the same thing. But in the cold war both sides claim identity between 
their ism and democracy. That is because democracy has won the thinking 
of the world; it has won the day. So the victor of the cold war will 
be the one that can convince the other that he is the most democratic. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   It has occurred 
to some that our progress might be due to the democracy that we have 
had rather than to an ism. The democratic process is apt to bypass isms. 
You could probably look at the degree of mixture and find it more or 
less conforming with the degree of efficiency. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The democratic 
process is not an ism. It prescribes no particular institutional pattern. 
Voting may be the least democratic thing there is. An examination is 
better than voting in  determining who should build a dam. It’s 
more efficient. But voting is the best device we have found for determining 
fundamental public policy. We have been developing along the representative 
type and centering it more in the executive, to the lament of many. 
But it is because we have been finding out that we can get more done 
that we want from the president than from the Congress. The president 
can’t pass the buck. It’s a pretty efficient device. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The popular determination 
of policy can eventuate in many ways. Capitalism lays claim to eventuating 
in the popular determination of both the quantity and the character 
of production, by “voting with dollars.” You demand a certain product 
in the market, and it is produced. So capitalism is democratic. Free 
buyer, free seller, open market. If you have a great many dollars it 
means that you have contributed a great deal to the community. This 
discretion is exercised in proportion to contribution. Socialists say 
that you should vote on production as persons, not as dollars. The co-op 
movement is halfway in between: (1) you receive in proportion to your 
contribution, and (2) you determine policy as a person. In a corporation 
it’s all on one-side—you receive in proportion to your contribution 
and you vote the same way. The Fabians say that they’re both wrong. 
Man should determine political and economic policy as an individual, 
and he should receive the same way. The determination of production 
should be political, according to them and to the communists. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   There is no synonymy 
between democracy and an ism. An ism specifies the institutions. Democracy 
does not. It eventuates in all kinds of institutions. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The Brannan Plan 
is being disparaged as subsidy, socialism, etc. It is unjust because 
someone gives something to someone else. The farmer, comprising 17% 
of the population, feeds everybody; he is subsidizing the nation. What’s 
the alternative cost between eating and not eating? What’s your food 
worth? We subsidize you, and we need a subsidy. This plan, the Brannan 
Plan, is being considered by the American people. It’s being aired 
in the newspapers, on the radio, and on the street corners. The Americans 
will make up their minds on it. The Brannan Plan could be adopted in 
any economy—communistic, fascistic, capitalistic. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The fact of an 
ism cannot preclude a mixture. But the secret of a solution to a problem 
is the democratic process. It is more to adopt a plan that will feed 
its people than is some other process. A dictator of the Supreme Court 
wouldn’t be so apt to. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The people ought 
to run the place. At bottom the problems are pretty simple. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">6-9:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Institutions perform both kinds 
of functions, and the two may or may not be incompatible. One can be 
inconsistent but not paradoxical. We do not live in a world of paradoxes. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Reason is necessary 
in solving problems. We use reason there. Most of the time we act habitually.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   What is a mature 
economy? The concept is nonsense. Usually it is used to mean that the 
institutions that have been growing up assume a dominant pattern. When 
that system of institutions meets difficulties in providing the means 
of life it is “mature.” When the problems get really rough it is 
in old age. But how can you view institutions in stages? If you included 
technological aspects you might be able to speak meaningfully of maturity. 
For example, in speaking of the use of mass production methods. </font></p>
