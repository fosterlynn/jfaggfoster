<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            Alfred Marshall effected the last reformulation
of the central content of economic thought which is still the world's common
sense.  He elaborated the thesis of Jevons.  The neo-classical thinkers shifted
from the labor theory of valuation to the price theory of valuation. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            The theory of value remains the same in Smith,
Ricardo, &amp; Marshall, even though one is measured by labor &amp; the other
by price.  This shift in the theory of valuation by Marshall's time eliminated
one of the most telling kinds of criticism of the classical theory.  You can't
look at the human heart--at utility--directly, says Marshall.  But you can look
at price, which measures utility rationally.  So economics became almost
exclusively a study of price. The economic process is fundamentally determined
by utility &amp; disutility, measured by comparative prices, which themselves
constitute the only evidence of what goes on in the human heart.  So you end up
with what you started with.  Price came to mean value.  A tautology: you explain
price in terms of price. It is the only evidence of what you are trying to
explain.  When you have explained price, you have explained production. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            Aggregate S&amp;D functions for Keynes are
different from S&amp;D for Marshall, but both are trying to get at the two
fundamental economic problems: explaining the level and the character of real
income.  The differences in individuals' experiences (such as Hottentots &amp;
Denverites) are due mostly to these two things. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            Behind demand is the principle of diminishing
utility: as the rate of accretion of units of a given asset increases, the want
satisfaction of each unit of that asset diminishes.  Behind supply is the
principle of increasing disutility: as the rate of use of an asset increases,
the disutility of each unit increases. These are feelings of the human heart. 
The position of equilibrium is teleological--it is where you are going, not
where you are. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            Equilibrium of comparative prices is thought to
show attainment of maximum utility for the community.  The general price level
is taken as determined by relative supply of money &amp; of goods. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            Marshall integrated real cost with comparative
cost through the use of 1) time period analysis &amp; 2) the idea of consumer's
surplus. </span></p>

This prevents the long run from reaching</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>Consumer's Surplus: &quot;...the price which a person pays
for a thing can never exceed and seldom comes up to that which he would be
willing to pay rather than go without it: so that the gratification which he gets
from its purchase generally exceeds that which he gives up in paying away its
price.&quot;  The excess price one would be willing to give up is the
consumer's surplus.  Not a surplus of goods or of capital; not the profit of
Smith.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            Price is determined by the utility of the
marginal unit.  At a given price, all units but the marginal one provide
surplus utility.  The community ought to maximize consumer's surplus by
reducing price or by raising demand. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            Pigou used consumer's surplus to validate
monopoly.  The fallacy with consumer's surplus is that it remains as inventory
and can't be realized as liquidity. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>The central problem for Utilitarians was to bring the forces
of supply and demand into contact so that a common element--thought to be
price--could be identified. Marshall no longer sought the real content of
utility, only its market impact. Comparative price doesn’t comment on real
value, which is &quot;as various as the people who experience it.” Liquidity is
inherent in a commodity, not value. Real cost is irrelevant, although the cost
of abstinence or labor must be calculated.  The vertical axis no longer
measures utility and disutility, but only utility considered as alternative
opportunities. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            Marshall boils down to an effort to explain the
economic process in terms of price, which is an expression of the utilitarian
theory of value.  A disutility curve constitutes a supply schedule of
constantly increasing cost; a utility curve constitutes a demand schedule of
constantly decreasing revenue.  Their intersection--equilibrium--identifies the
level of employment and of production.  This point shows the price per unit
&amp; the supply of each factor in its market. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            The average supply schedule inclines up in the
competitive model because it is a schedule of variations comprised by entry and
exit of firms.  The individual firm's supply schedule is U shaped, while its
demand schedule is infinitely elastic. Gossen's first law holds.  You can't
bargain or struggle for the market.  The struggle is not between sellers but
between sellers and the factors of production.  No one seller can affect
price.  The intersection of the marginal unit cost and average unit revenue
curves gives the optimum point.  It is slightly to the right of the lowest
point on the average variable cost curve, so firms are operating under
conditions of slightly increasing costs. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            Why use S&amp;D?  If you're going to use the
utilitarian philosophy, this is the way it comes out in human behavior.  It is
purposeful behavior, not a dance of the atoms. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            Marshall didn't foresee monopolistic competition
(Chamberlin &amp; Robinson) or oligopoly, but did develop the idea of the
representative firm--what all firms would look like in an industry if all were
the same.  Since they aren't the same, the industry supply schedule is derived
from the sum of individual schedules. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            What is a commodity?  Marshall identified it as
all items of which the sale of one affects the sale of the others--using the
price theory of valuation.  This is clearly unsatisfactory when you get to
income theory, because the sale of peanuts really does affect the sale of
cars.  Veblen permits a satisfactory identification by use of the
instrumental-ceremonial.  If two items perform the same function they are the
same commodity. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            For Marshall, equilibrium is stable so long as
the determining factors remain stable.  He uses equilibrium in both micro &amp;
macro analysis.  Now we typically use the representative firm as micro.  The
representative firm is one of Marshall's important contributions. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            An oligopolist's revenue schedule is more
elastic if the other firms don't act as he does.  Then he is more inclined to
reduce price in order to increase sales.  In enterprises of this sort sometimes
you don't find an equilibrium process.  Other firms act as the first did not
because he did but for the same reasons as he did.  It may result that he gets
out beyond average unit cost. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            How do time periods play into this analysis?  In
the market price period there is no cost effect.  In the short run, cost begins
to influence price but is not in equilibrium with demand.  In the long run,
supply is pushed to equilibrium but you don't spend any time there; it is a
point, not a period.  It identifies the direction toward which the operation is
tending.  In the secular trend period, equilibrium itself is moving, giving a
&quot;dynamic&quot; reason for never reaching equilibrium. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            Veblen criticized Marshallian theory as
teleological in nature because it identifies a condition toward which you are
going which is an ultimate end. Cosmological theory is often teleological too,
having a beginning, an end, &amp; describing only what lies between. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            The attribute of teleology relates to time
periods.  Each period is defined by the characteristics of the commodity
involved.  The construct of time is the weakest construct in terms of
identification.  It is very difficult to understand.  Physicists have been
jarred by the realization that they don't understand time.  Einsteinian theory
is relative in analysis but assumed a constant.  There is a problem here. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            In economics we have to use time because we are
dealing not with simple quantities but with quantities over time.  But time
period analysis gets us into trouble.  A long run is made up of short runs, but
each is differently comprised, so how could the second add up to the first? 
(E.g., the short run is not affected by price while long run is; at any time,
how long have market forces been in play? What are the causal sequences at any
given time?)  Here is one area in which Marshallian and Keynesian theories are
at odds.  Mathematically one is expressed in difference equations, the other in
differential equations. (In differential equations, is it presumed that a line
is made up of an infinite number of points?  This is impossible.  If not what
is the assumption?)  Compare Mill's<u> Logic</u> with Dewey's <u>Logic</u>. 
The American idea of time finds application in the Keynesian theory.  It
doesn't matter how close one time period is to another--one can't use Mill's
principle of proximity or juxtaposition. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            You can use the time period analysis validly in
a descriptive sense, but can it explain anything?  Newtonian analysis doesn’t
work very well in atomic physics because of this kind anything?  Newtonian
analysis doesn't work very well in atomic physics because of this kind of
analysis. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>Theory of probability:  &quot;Certain&quot; doesn't mean
&quot;absolute.&quot;  A lot of problems arise because of the different ways in
which Marshall and Keynes use time, even though Keynes doesn't talk about it
except in the sense of so much income per year. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            <u>The General Theory</u> of Keynes had greater
impact on the everyday life of everybody in a short time than ever before in
history, because of two circumstances: the economic situation of the world when
his book appeared, and the reputation of the man.  Everyone uses his symbols
&amp; some use his constructs, but the real thing about his theory is its
actual content. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            Keynes was trying to get at income.  He assumed
that income and employment of factors vary together.  [You might question this;
it might be a question of the state of the arts.]  The wage unit means the
money price of a labor unit. Labor unit means the money's worth of the product
of the lowest paid labor. Employment is the rate of sale of labor units; so the
wage unit measures the rate of sale of labor units. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            The aggregate supply function is the
relationship between the aggregate supply price &amp; the level of employment. 
The aggregate demand function is the relationship between the aggregate demand
price and the level of employment.  The former means that schedule of how much
the entrepreneur would have to expect to receive in terms of price to induce
him to offer various rates of production.  The latter is what he does in fact
expect to receive by virtue of offering sales at various rates.  Where they
intersect is where you are, not where you are going.  The relationship between
these two price schedules &amp; the level of N is what constitutes the
functions.  His whole thesis is an explanation of these functions. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            Keynes's is a theory of the proximate
determination of income in the instantaneous sense.  He identifies three
independent variables: the propensity to consume, the marginal efficiency of
capital, and the rate of interest.  The determination of these is not
demonstrated by Keynes, but he does demonstrate their independence of each
other.  This is important. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            The propensity to consume is the ratio between C
&amp; Y.  The MPC relates to the ratio between increments of C &amp; Y.  This
is what is at stake because what we are concerned with is variations in these
variables and the direction of those variations.  There is no time axis here;
this is a schedule at a given point in time.  It can change over time, but in
fact remains fairly steady, enough so to predict with considerable confidence. 
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            For a nation as a whole, aggregate C/aggregate Y
need not fall anywhere on the schedule.  (Income is a &quot;constant
variable&quot; in that it varies constantly--there are no plateaus in income.) 
If you use the expression &quot;propensity to consume&quot; unmodified, you
simply mean C/Y. It is independent not in that it has no determinants but in
that it is a function of the mores and folkways of the community; it is
&quot;given&quot; as far as the economic problem at hand is concerned.  [Does
it shift if the rate of interest changes?  See below.]  Historically the
schedule has shifted to the right as Y changes, but not much. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            Apparently no one questions directly the
independence of C/Y, but indirectly many do.  Orthodox economists say C/Y
changes if interest rate changes.  (If C/Y is independent, S/Y must be
dependent).  The propensity to save is not independent because two independent
variables cannot summate to a constant. Part of the problems in theory have
arisen by virtue of the effort to use S/Y as an independent variable, as it is
in Marshallian analysis.  Econometricians especially do this without
considering that C/Y can't also be independent.  An individual can save more or
less out of a given income, but a community cannot; it changes its income, not
its propensity to save. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            The level of N is the rate of sale of labor
units, which Keynes arrived at by dividing the wage bill by the wage unit.  In
classical tradition, full employment is assumed.  Ricardo's position was that
so long as there is any effective D, any labor unit can find a job if it is
willing to work for what it is really worth, i.e., what the community is ready,
willing, and able to pay. This constitutes the wage rate.  In some truistic
sense, the classical  position is true.  What Keynes attacks is its pertinence
to the economic process.  He says involuntary unemployment exists when the rate
of offer for sale of labor is increased to meet an increase in the rate of
offer to purchase labor at the going rate or slightly lower.  His theory  also
explains why there is always involuntary unemployment:  the upper &amp; lower
limits of employment are inside 100% propensity to consume and true inflation. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            The second independent variable in Keynes's
analysis, the MEC, is that rate of discount which would bring the series of
annuities expected throughout the life of an additional unit of a capital asset
into equality with the current supply price.  Or, the MEC is the current
expectation of net proceeds that could be realized by purchase of an additional
unit of a capital asset.  Or, the MEC is close to the current expectation of
profits expected from the purchase of an additional unit.  Keynes says it is
determined independently of the other variables.  He doesn't go into its
determinants, but you don't need to in order to know that you will gain more or
less by buying a debt than a capital asset. It is institutionally determined. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            The third independent variable, and the locus of
greatest attack, is the interest rate.  He sets up two alternatives to
liquidity: you can lend your money or you can invest.  The rate of interest,
Keynes says, is determined by the S&amp;D for money--a time rate--as distinct
from the S&amp;D for saving (a quantity) in the classical theory.  This rate
equates liquidity preference with the quantity of money.  In western society,
the central bank &amp; fiscal policy determine M. There is no need to analyze
the determinants of liquidity preference to know if it is less than or greater
than M. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            The real wage rate is how much wage goods the
money wage rate will buy. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            The three independent variables are all ratios,
independent because they can vary--as ratios--in one of two directions, not
many directions.  Also none is a component of Y.  The propensity to consume is
the ratio between current magnitudes,while the others are concerned with
expectations.  S/Y &amp; I/Y are dependent variables.  S &amp; I are dependent
upon the propensity to consume. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>KEYNES'S THESIS: </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>        1)  The propensity to consume &amp; the level of Y
vary in opposite directions. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>        2)  Therefore, the rate of I varies in the same
direction as Y but at a higher rate than Y. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>        3)  Therefore, given the schedule of the propensity
to consume, the level of Y is</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

datum, in the sense of constancy, is the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>              propensity to consume. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>It is the equation between S &amp; I in the aggregate, and
the difference between them in the individual case, that constitutes the
essence of Keynesian theory. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>            Universally,
income is defined as consumption plus saving.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            Again universally, the part of Y spent neither
for C or I is called hoarding.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            H = Y - (C + I), or H = S - I.  The Keynesian
position is that S = I &amp; therefore H = 0. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>Demonstration that S = I.  Start with the necessary
situation of equality between sales and purchases.  Out of sales &amp;
purchases, in order to receive income that is spent neither for C or I, sales
would have to exceed purchases. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            In Keynes, inventory is part of I.  He defines
inventory in different ways.  It is goods produced minus goods destroyed.  The
upper limit of destruction is unity; i.e., the MPC cannot be greater than
unity, he thinks, because as it approaches unity the multiplier approaches
infinity.   In Keynes's system, you don't have to quarrel with the character of
C &amp; I, or about who owns it.  The only question is, is production added to
inventory or isn't it?  In order to get hoarding you would have to have
receipts from sales in excess of purchases, or proceeds in the aggregate in
excess of expenditures.  Individually, of course, hoarding is possible. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            There is no escape from the equality of S &amp;
I as time rates unless you can prove that sales don't equal purchases or unless
you define I as not including inventory.  But even doing this does not keep
saving from equaling additions to inventory. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            It is only production that provides the means of
life; Adam Smith was right in his quarrel with the Mercantilists.  Somebody has
got to produce.  A community cannot get more money by selling more than it
buys; it has to get the money some other way. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            How does money come into existence?  An
individual gets it by selling more than he buys.  Where is the money coming
from?  Keynes would say that is not the question.  In aggregate terms you look
at the problem in a different way.  The community cannot save money; it can
save only goods.  How does the money get there for individuals to hoard? 
Keynes says the quantity of money is determined not by excess of sales over
purchases but by central banking policy and government fiscal policy.  Money is
peculiar, not a commodity like wheat.  It is 100% liquid, and you can't wear it
out.  Using it does not diminish its value. The individual gets money from the
mint &amp; from the bank.  Banks are required by law to create funds; they do
not get someone else's funds to give you; they create money just by writing it
down.  They don't create funds for themselves(by law, although they sometimes
get around this by loaning money to each other); they create funds for
individuals. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            A great many things follow from this thesis. 
The question of aggregate hoarding is not just a matter of taxonomy or
definition; it is a question of fact. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            One thing that follows is that I cannot get
returns as would be assigned it on grounds of the equational theory of
justice--equating cost with reward. According to classical theory, the return
to capital has to be sufficient to pay for the disutility of abstaining from C
in order to save in order to invest.  Not so says Keynes.  I is not furthered
by abstaining from C; S can't occur until I occurs, since the community can't
save money.  There is no necessary direct relationship between already
accomplished saving &amp; the current rate of I.  (There is a slight, indirect
relationship here, through the effect of the quantity of money on the rate of
interest.)  The presence of funds does not constitute effective D for I; the
latter is constituted by the expectation of gaining a return. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            Whatever is technically feasible is financially
possible; financial resources are not a limit on economic activity.  Thus the
return to capital cannot be pled on grounds of previous abstention from C (real
cost).  Profits would have to be determined on other grounds than the
utilitarian idea of equational justice.  In Keynesian terms, the distribution of
Y is a matter of public policy, not a matter of inexorable laws of S&amp;D with
regard to factors.  So the approach to proper public policy becomes quite
different.  The dismalness of economics is erased and a theory of progress
emerges.  Man can, through his own judgment, proceed technologically to the
limits of his capacity.  The question ceases to be &quot;Can it be done
financially?&quot; and becomes &quot;Ought it to be done economically?&quot; 
The limits of capital formation are established by technological and
institutional factors, not by financial capacity.  And the problem of the
distribution of Y (to capital, but not to other factors) is limited by the
necessary 0 value of H.  Income is factor costs; profits are 0. Income to
holders of capital will have to be in some form other than profit. The
community can provide Y to capital through subsidy, and of course it does. We
do it through autonomous I.  Against the funds invested there is an equivalent
debt; or alternatively stated, additional assets are balanced by additional
debt. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            The classicists thought profits are 0 in the
long run; Keynes in an instantaneous sense. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            As the rate of I increases, funds accrue to
factors and thus enter as effective D received as proceeds from the sale of
factors.  Since the propensity to consume can range between unity and 0, the
market will not provide discretionary income to the entrepreneurs in the
aggregate.  This raises a contingency now which did not appear when the
relation between the size of plant and the size of market was small.  Then you
could allow the more efficient to gain a return from the bankruptcy of the less
efficient.  Now the size of plant is so large relative to the size of the
market that the community cannot allow bankruptcy to work the way it used to. 
Now you can go bankrupt and still continue to operate.  We have found ways to
get Y to entrepreneurs because of the peculiar limitation on returns to
capital. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>THEORY OF THE RATE OF INTEREST.  Both classical and
Keynesian are set up in terms of supply and demand, which is unfortunate. 
Marshallians: demand for and supply of saving, saving being a component of Y, a
time rate.  Keynes: demand for and supply of money, money not a time rate but
is simply how much I has been accomplished, both autonomous and induced. The
demand for money is a function of technological and institutional factors. 
This demand is motivated by three motives: transactions, precautionary, and
speculative. The last is the biggest volume-wise because it relates to the
value of goods with respect to money.  You can gain by guessing better than the
market what the market will guess.  You can't sell a future unless someone is
willing to buy a future.  Among the prices which vary is the rate of interest. 
If you think interest rates are going up you will be inclined to hold cash,
while if you think interest rates are going down you will want to buy assets. 
But no matter what you try to do you can't change M, you simply change i.  This
rate must equate the supply of with the demand for M; supply doesn't change in
response to supply price or demand, so i changes.  In this way, money is a
unique &quot;commodity.&quot;  This is pretty sloppy theory, but it doesn't
matter as far as the central thesis of Keynes is concerned. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            Most of the debate between Marshallians &amp;
Keynesians on rate of i is not very important, except in one respect: if i
changes, what else must change: supply of money or rate of saving?  The former.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            The trouble with both theories is that you can't
explain a price (interest) in terms of S&amp;D.  The rate of saving is a
dependent variable--dependent on the propensity to consume and on Y.  It would
have to be independent if determined by S&amp;D.  It is not affected directly
by i; only indirectly because I is affected by it.  For Keynes, saving is not
what is on hand; it is a time rate, S = Y -C.  What is on hand? Money. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            The trouble with the Keynesian theory of the
rate of interest is whether or not the supply of money determines this rate. 
Is i a payment for parting with liquidity?  To the individual it may be.  But
what liquidity does a bank separate from when it makes a loan?  None.  It
creates the funds.  What liquidity does the Treasury separate from when it
prints a stack of bills? None.  Our legal limitation on the creation of funds
is not operative in effect because it is much higher than the loans our banking
system actually makes.  We control loans in other ways: rate of interest raised
by the Fed &amp; M reduced by sale of government securities.  So Keynesians say
rate of interest went up because M went down.  The causality really runs the
other way. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            What is the economic cost of making a bank
loan?  It is hard to find.  It's not risk; the bank has to have security. 
Bankers pretend they are undergoing great disutility when they make a loan, but
there is no disutility.  It costs them more not to make a loan; they don't
undergo saving to make a loan.  (But labor is not paid to overcome disutility
of work either.  The whole of the distribution of Y is a matter of public
policy, not payment for disutility. And Keynes's theory is closer to the truth
on this point than we were before.) The concept of cost is a real problem
between Keynesian &amp; Marshallian theory. What is the Keynesian supply
price?  You can drive prices to incremental cost(railroad competition a good
example): is this S&amp;D?  Not quite.  The incremental cost for a
hydroelectric plant is enormously lower than for a coal powered plant.  What
does determine price? </span></p>

font-family:Arial'>DIFFERENCES IN THE TWO THEORIES: </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>l)  Philosophical foundations: logic, value, integration. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            Marshall makes quite clear his philosophical
principles and how he applies them to economics--utilitarian philosophy,
want-satisfaction, Benthamite hedonism, modified by J.S. Mill. Keynes does not
set forth his basic philosophy; it must be derived from his economic theory. 
One difference with Marshall is the theory of value, the criterion of
judgment.  Keynes is applying the American instrumental efficiency idea: full
use of factors, full participation in the economic process.  He abandons
utilitarianism.  Instrumental philosophy is built around the problem-solving
process.  In American common sense usage, utilitarian might mean pragmatic,
down to earth, useful.  But its professional usage  is not that at all; it is
romantic philosophy, attributional rather than opaque.  Not for Keynes.  You
can't reduce feelings of the human heart to S&amp;D.  The independent variables
are not S&amp;D but are institutionally determined. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            These two philosophical systems are not treated
in the literature, nor their fundamental determinants, nor how they
differ--particularly the theories of human nature.  In Marshall, man is a
utilitarian creature; in Keynes a problem-solving creature envisioning
productive participation in the economic process as a positive good, not a
disutility.  The continuing factors are processual in nature; evolutionary
analysis rather than teleological; process toward arbitrary pattern.  What
performs in Keynesian theory the function performed by S&amp;D in Marshall? 
Ayres &amp; Veblen hint at it. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>2)  In methodology, the most immediate &amp; apparent
differences have to do with equilibrium, cause-effect relationships, and
equational forms.  They look the same on paper, but they aren't.  One method is
to use instantaneous equations, one going toward equilibrium.  What is the
significance of such differences?  One could examine the differences in terms
of tools used--difference vs. differential equations. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            There are two typologies of basic blocks of
methodology in terms of models and theories.  A model is a packet of things. 
It uses deductive logic; has certain assumptions; goes from more general to
more specific; makes assumptions about the world and deductions from them.  The
axiomatic method, is exemplified by geometry. Axioms are definitions.  [In econometrics,
is it accurate to say that S = I is a definitional equation?  It involves more
than definition.]  You don't test results empirically; results depend on
assumptions.  The validity of Euclidian geometry does not depend on testing.  A
model will predict only insofar as the assumptions fit the real world. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            Theory is another basic type of methodology. 
You are going from specific to general.  You say if the first is true, the next
probably is true; there is no logical necessity that it be true.  In a theory
system there has to be at least one statement that is empirically verifiable. 
Theories too, however, have certain assumptions.  You are never limited by an
upper boundary in this type of reasoning.  You can keep on going.  In a model
you cannot do this, cannot go beyond the assumptions. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            Models can be criticized only on internal
logical consistency; theories are judged by their ability to predict.  Marshall
says you need both inductive and deductive logic, but uses the latter in his
utility analysis.  You can't go beyond his assumptions--feelings of the human
heart.  But he doesn't use a strict model type of analysis because he does
question assumptions of classicists--labor theory of value.  Keynes uses
empirical data to question the assumptions of neoclassicists; basically also a
model type of reasoning.  He goes back to assumptions of expectations, but not
in an axiomatic sense.  His system still rests on its ability to predict; in
this sense it is theoretical reasoning. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

determined by the rate of voluntary saving in the long run; comparative I is
determined by the rate of profit.  For Keynes, the rate of I is determined by
the relationship between the MEC &amp; the rate of interest; the character of I
is in direct proportion to the MEC within the area of I. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

of assumptions constitutes a group of propositions in relation to which his
conclusions constitute their validification.  The fundamental
determinants--feelings--are unobservable.  The Keynesian system is </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

Aquinas said public debt was immoral. Adam Smith opposed to public debt because
of anti-mercantilism: the state is less efficient than individuals and would
use public funds for riotous living. J.B. Say also vehement in opposition, but
didn't think public consumption different from private; he wanted saving rather
than consumption.  Ricardo said national debt is one of the most terrible
scourges to affect the nation.  When government borrows and spends, it is just
gone, lost.  But Malthus thought public debt not evil.  J.S. Mill thought in
1848 that government could borrow funds that would otherwise go to waste.  But
