<h3 align=center style='text-align:center'>American Contributions to Economic Thought</h3>

<h4 class=Body align=center style='text-align:center'>lecture notes</h4>

<p class=Body align=center style='text-align:center'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>FRONTIERSMEN</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The first complete break
from the European system of economic thought is the American contribution.  The
frontier--an area of land which is outside the control of  a judicial
establishment and outside the market process--accounts for what is distinctive
in American thought, but not for all distinctions of American culture.  That
experience of living outside the “law” forced the mountain men and pioneers to
construct a problem-solving theory of value and economic thought. </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            There may have been
half-a-million Native Americans in North America at the time of Columbus.  The
continent might be considered overpopulated for their stone-age state of the
arts.  These “Indians” taught skills to the incoming Americans, such as
trapping, stalking, agriculture, and eating habits.  This allowed the
frontiersmen to supply themselves outside the European market.  They often
treated Native Americans shamefully, but they engaged in productive activity
much more than in exercising discretion over others.  Their basic problem was
how to occupy new lands, as distinct from the common human experience of
outsiders conquering dense populations of earlier inhabitants of new lands. </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            On the frontier there was
considerable separateness of individuals.  Every individual or family had to
perform all operations for gaining a livelihood--without institutional
prescription.  They were <i>de facto</i> almost anarchists, but they mastered
the arts of sustainability, which included cooperation based on need--building
a cabin requires more than one person.  An individual must do whatever he can
according to his skills, and the community will help in those activities beyond
his skills.  They agreed with the classical theory that the common interest is
the same as individual interests.  But they rejected the corollary theory
claiming that interests are brought into identity by market structures.  This
is the unique American contribution that has led to the development of theories
of collaboration that are generically democratic.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Frontiersmen had a
plethora of skills, and demanded the right to be different as long as these
characteristics did not hinder the effort to live.  Freedom in the American
experience means the enlargement of the area of genuine choice, whereas freedom
in the European sense means an absence of prescription.  They recognized the
relationship between ethics and productive activity--the congruence between
material welfare and moral validity.  They were quasi-athiestic, rejecting an
institutional idea of a Supreme being.  They were religious in identifying the
instrumental concept of problem solving.  In that illiterate society, a man’s
word was his bond.  Society could not function without honesty, so deception
was treated harshly.   </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>             Frontiersmen found
resources available outside of the market process.  No markets existed to
correlate the factors of production.  Land was a free resource.  It was not
necessary to accumulate money before buying land and earning a living. 
Ownership depended on productive use.  Labor was viewed not as a cost but as
necesssary and fun.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The frontier experience
led Americans not to accept the <u>Wealth of Nations</u> as Europeans did. 
They rejected its premise that wanting is the essential economic problem and
removing want is the solution.  They rejected the labor market as maximizing
the wealth of nations.  They disassociated investment from personal saving. 
Frontiersmen were always in debt, but built the most productive nation in
history.  Money  cost was unimportant; bankruptcy came to be used to reassign
debt without change of organization or cessation of production, permitting weak
firms to compete with strong by eliminating fixed costs on interest-bearing
debt and lowering average variable costs so that prices can be lowered.  Real
costs are important, but don’t include work, which is necessary and fun.  The
classical and utilitarian theories could not be used to solve problems.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>THOMAS JEFFERSON</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Jefferson is the best
spokesman for the central ideational content of American intellectual
development found on the frontier.  He opposed all “isms” because he recognized
that the actualities are non-institutional in nature.  His “Declaration of
Independence” asserts that all invidious distinctions among men are figments of
the imagination; it does not mean equal opportunity.  He rejected Smith,
finding market assignment of labor and wealth to be fatal.  From the frontier
he saw that work--not saving--creates the wealth of nations; that investment
generates savings (anticipating Keynes), and that money has nothing to do with
capital formation: price always equals cost.  Capital formation is not possible
with the wage system unless debt is increased.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Jefferson agreed with
Smith that capital formation is related to progress, but disagreed on its
nature.  He was willing to use markets to reach ends, but not to determine
ends.  He found valid ends to be instrumental rather than utilitarian.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Productive labor was the
base of Jefferson’s theory of progress.  Agriculture was at first the only
field where labor would be of value, but when small machines were invented for
home manufacturing, that endeavor became productive.  He wrote the following to
John Jay from Paris in 1785:</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Cultivators of the earth
are the most valuable citizens.  They are the most</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            vigorous, the most
independent, the most virtuous, and they are tied to the</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            country and wedded to its
liberty and interest by the most lasting bands.  As</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            long, therefore, as they
can find employment in this line, I would not convert</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            them into mariners,
artisans, or anything else.  But our citizens will find</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            employment in this line
till their numbers, and of course their productions, </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            become too great for the
demand both internal and foreign.  This is not the</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            case as yet, and probably
will not be for a considerable time.  As soon as it</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            is, the surplus of hands
must be turned to something else.  I should then</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            perhaps wish to turn them
to the sea in preference to manufactures,</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            because comparing the
characters of the two classes, I find the former the</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            most valuable citizens.  I
consider the class of artificers as the panders of</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            vice and the instruments
by which the liberties of a country are generally</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            overturned.  However, we
are not free to decide this question on principles</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            of theory only.  Our
people are decided in the opinion that it is necessary for</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            us to take a share in the
occupation of the ocean, and their established</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            habits induce them to
require that the sea be kept open to them, and that</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            line of policy be pursued
which will render the use of that element as</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            great as possible to them.<a
href="#_ftn373" name="_ftnref373" title=""><span class=FootnoteIndex><span
class=FootnoteIndex><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>[373]</span></span></span></a>
</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Agriculture was not only
for one class of people.  If there were to be more than one class, it would be
the base from which other institutions would grow.  He wrote in 1803:</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            It is a science of the
very first order.  It counts among its handmaids the most</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            respectable science, such
as Chemistry, Natural Philosophy, Mechanics, Mathe-</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            matics generally, Natural
History, and Botany.  In every College and University, a</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            professorship of
agriculture, and the class of its students, might be honored as </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            the first.  Young men
closing their academical education with this, as the crown of </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            all other sciences,
fascinated with its solid charms, and at a time when they are to</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            choose an occupation,
instead of crowding the other classes, would return to the</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            farms of their fathers,
their own, or those of others, and replenish and invigorate</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            a calling, now languishing
under contempt and oppression.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Jefferson did not mention
the price of hired labor.  His only relation with this problem was land owners
bringing immigrants to the United States where they would be in servitude. 
After his passage was paid, the laborer heard no mention of a time limit to his
work.  The immigrant was expected to settle on his own land.  The subsistence
for the farmer is the only labor cost mentioned, but the farmer acting in an
entrepreneurial capacity.  When Jefferson referred to the word subsistence, he
gives the impression that the living standard is much higher than the standard
referred to in the classical definition.  He never defined the word because
labor did not enter into the market process.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>THORSTEIN VEBLEN.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The separate
identification of economic inquiry in America didn’t really begin until around
1900.  This was a period of intellectual flowering: the beginnings of sociology
and anthropology and the instrumental theory of Dewey.  Most PhDs had studied
in Germany; some, like Ely, were escapting Euroepan influences.  Then came
Veblen, who “compelled a whole generation of economists to search their hearts
lest the truth be not in them”(Homan)  Here is the first real break in the
character of economic analysis.  The heterodoxy of both Marx and Keynes
maintained orthodox roots.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Veblen rejected the
orthodox preconception that the economic process is teleological--final causes
worked out by selfish human nature, by an unseen hand rather than by
cause-effect relationships--because it is both taxonomic and tautological;
assumptions and conclusions are the same, self-contained and self-warranting. 
Guidance by the invisible hand is non-causal in its determination.  Evidence of
teleology: 1) the natural course may be deflected by man--who is not part of
nature; 2) when the natural course of events is deflected, it recovers (heals
itself) and continues to its intended end when obstruction is removed.  Since
the course of economic events resumes, it must be determined by factors outside
of process.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Veblen rejected the
universality of the market as an institutional structure, of selfishness as the
dominant human motive, and price as the guide of human behavior.  He focused on
the function of economic activities as providing the means of life for
community continuity.  Anthropology provided the major subject matter for his
method.  He recognized the foolishness of the orthodox explanation when applied
to primitive societies--the impossibility of describing the fishing of South
Sea islanders wading in the surf with sticks and chanting magic formulae as a
division of labor guided by the market and the rational selfishness of the
participants.  He saw that land, labor, and capital are not significant
categories for identifying the means of production.  More important are customs
and habits of the people, and their knowledge of technology.  He thus came to
believe that economics should study the institutional patterns and technology
of any people to understand their economy, without any preconception that these
patterns and knowledge would lead toward any equilibrium.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Veblen claimed to make no
value judgments in his analyses, but in every one of his works he tests
existing patterns against what was technologically feasible.  Thus, it is fair
to say that he took technology to be the locus of validity, although many of
his followers as well as his critics have not recognized this.  His method for
testing the suitability of any pattern of economic activities was to apply the
Veblenian distinction between instrumental behavior and ceremonial behavior. 
His distinction between technology and institutions confused the constitution
of institutions--patterns of habits--with the determination of
institutions--their origin.  Veblen seems to be getting at the insight that all
answers to economic problems take the form of institutional adjustment.  His
basic mistake was to believe that institutions are a result of unconscious
habituation, which denies any grounds for intelligent institutional adjustment.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Veblen thought technology
and institutions are independently progressive.  Neither depends upon the
other.  Institutions come into being through habituation, and they change with
something of a consistent sequence.  He didn’t know just what this sequence was;
he found no direction in the process.  It is in terms not of an approach toward
a particular institutional pattern but toward greater economy and efficiency. 
He was thinking of instrumental efficiency but didn’t know it because he didn’t
recognize the significance of science, he couldn’t validate it.  Individual
scientists probably do proceed because of idle curiosity, but that does not
mean that science is without significance or rational basis. </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Starting in his <u>Theory
of the Leisure Class</u> in 1899 and continuing through most of his work, he
identified conspicuous consumption as a pattern of behavior common to all
societies above a mere subsistence level of production.  As a community
increases its productivity, different classes develop methods for appropriating
whatever part of the community’s produce is not strictly necessary for
production, and using it in ways that are reputed to be productive and that the
whole community accepts as proper.  Thus, early warriors would steal women and
men to work for them; after they had a large number, they would have the women
conspicuously display their exemption from labor as evidence of the wealth of
their owner-husband, but always with the imputation that amassing wealth
resulted from contributing to the wealth of the community.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            What does this have to do
with economics?  It shows that the resources of communities are not distributed
rationally by a market for the purpose of maximizing production.  It shows that
a society with rank and status distinctions--i.e., all societies--does not
leave individuals free to seek their selfish interests, since the structure of
the society assigns functions to its members.  And it suggests that price is a
symbol of the existing structure--that goods with high prices are consumed by
the proper people--rather than an indication of what is intrinsically desirable
and good.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>Criticism of marginal utility theory:</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            1)  Wants are taken as
given.  Analysis is limited to the theory of distribution and has only a
secondary bearing on any other economic phenomena.   But consumption is a
cultural trait, and to explain either demand or supply, one must go beyond the
market process.  The utility concept of value necessarily is a matter of
valuation.  Valuation stems from choices of alternative utilities
(anticipations of want-satisfaction) which are a function of previous
consumption, which is the direct concomitant of distribution.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            2)  Prices of commodities
are taken as given in order to reach answers about prices of
commodities--tautology. Since this theory is necessarily concerned with
adjustments of relative values to a given situation, it can add little, if any,
to a theory of growth, change, or process--the most obtrusive and consequential
facts observable in economic life--and thus can offer little to understanding
the determination of the situation itself.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            3)  The institutional
structure is taken as given, and the analysis limited to adaptation to the
demands of the main chance rather than to problem solving.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            4)  Marginal utility analysis
is confined to the ground of sufficient reason instead of proceeding on the
ground of efficient cause.  Here is another revelation of Veblen’s basic
mistake.  He thought that habit emerges full-blown, but it is a matter of
choice in its initial deviation from an established pattern.  It involves
discretion.  The only way that a cause-effect sequence comes into institutional
structure is through becoming a sufficient reason, and so all effective cause
at one stage in the process of institutional adjustment takes the form of
sufficient reason.  This blocked Veblen and his followers, but was understood
by Ayres.  An idea must become a sufficient reason in the comprehension of the
community so that members can modify their behavior.  This mistake came from applying
what is true in the physical sciences to humans: molecules don’t think and have
discretion as humans do.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            5)  Marginal utility is
limited to individual motivation and action, and to their arithmetic sums as
aggregates.  Veblen’s genetic theory examines individual conduct, but only in
those respects in which it leads toward habituation, and so toward change or
stability in the institutional fabric.  Veblen was seeking a theory of
institutional adjustment, but precluded himself from it by confusing the
content (habits) of institutions with their determination (by discretion).</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Veblen criticized price
and utility theory extensively, but his positive contributions came mostly in
the area of economic growth.  For orthodox economists, economic growth meant
and still tends to mean more of the same--more land, labor, and capital to
produce more of the goods already used in a society.  For Veblen, growth was an
evolutionary process wherein the structure of a society changed.  The reason
for change he identified as the pressure of technology.  Much like Marx, he
recognized that new methods of production caused strains in the patterns of
habits followed by a community.  With technology as his standard, he said that
a community could change its institutions to fit the new productive processes,
or it might maintain patterns of institutions which inhibited production and
even led to the destruction </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>of society.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Foster thinks Veblen’s
best book on development is<u> Imperial Germany</u>.  Here he studied the
reasons for England’s leading role in the adoption of industrial technology in
the 1700s, and the reasons for Germany’s rapid assimilation of those techniques
after 1870.  He shows how England’s backwardness in the Elizabethan Era made
her able to borrow then-current handicraft techniques from the continent, and
then to develop these into new production methods because of her relative
freedom from the wars, political intrigues, and rigid class structures of
Europe.  But by the middle 1850s technological progress was leaving England
behind.  Because much of her capital was obsolete--small railroad cars suitable
for wooden or iron rails but inefficient when steel rails were perfected--her
captains of industry focused on protecting their investments; sports were
highly developed as a means of lessening industrial efficiency by consuming
time and energy nonproductively; women were forced into Victorian clothing and
forbidden to produce.  While in Germany, the Prussian rulers had an educated
work force used to constant application, women still worked in the fields, and
the wealthy were not burdened with obsolete investments.  In addition, since
the Germans had not developed the democratic institutions which grew up in
England with handicraft and machine industry, the rulers could give orders and
be certain of obedience.  Thus within decades Germany came to surpass the
productivity of England.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Not only did Veblen
explain this case of economic development, he also predicted the warfare which
was apt to result from the use of modern technology by a primitive dynastic
state such as Germany was--a state in which the people blindly followed the
leader and where the leaders were high-powered bullies convinced that might
makes right.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>Veblen’s contribution:</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            1)  Distinction between
technology and institutions, although not accurately stated.  He realized that
given data must be taken from technology--the state of the industrial arts--but
he didn’t go far enough.  He failed to recognize that institutions have both
instrumental and ceremonial functions.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            His critics say that since
he was not going toward any “ism,” he was not going anywhere--his analysis was
directionless and meaningless.  But he recognized that the identification of
direction--meaning the criterion of judgment--cannot be stated validly in terms
of institutional structure.  To Veblen, an “ism” exists as an idea, and is a
useful structure for identifying ideas in reference to a theory of value.  He
noted that these patterns are accepted as natural, but in fact are not so.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Foster maintains that
Veblen’s distinction between technologically valid patterns of behavior and
ceremonial patterns which falsely claim to be productive is what economists
need today to help develop the many backward economies of the world.  We can’t
tell India to get more capital as long as Indians allow cows to roam the
streets eating rather than providing food.  We can’t tell them to work harder
with their ox-drawn plows.  We must educate them to recognize which of their
institutions are obstacles to a modern economy, and also help them protect
other institutions which are undoubtedly valuable.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            2)  The test of the
maturity of scientific theory is its ability to predict, and Veblen is the only
social scientist who ever lived who was able to predict.  Next to him was
Keynes.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            What Veblen started is the
development of the theory of institutions, of which economics is one phase.  He
gives us a chance to work toward a general theory, which is now lacking.  He
does away with ismatic criteria for the judgment of direction.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Eric Roll, in <u>A History
of Economic Thought</u> (Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall, 3rd edition
1956), dismissed the significance of the Veblenian distinction (449) and
lamented the little that Veblen left to replace classical economics (447).  That
is like asking an atheist what he will put in the place of the Holy Trinity. 
If classical economics focused on the market system, and Veblen’s analysis
shows that the market system just describes what a community does and not at
all what it should do, then is it pertinent to ask Veblen to provide an
alternative analysis of the market?  Is it not necessary that economists
redefine their subject?  Keynes forced economists to concern themselves with
institutional patterns such as the consumption function.  Now work on economic
development is forcing many to come to grips with technology and culture.  But
still the content of theoretical economics is to describe how a series of
forces will push us to a static equilibrium if we will only let them work or help
them at the right times.  Where does Veblenian analysis lead?  To genetic study
of culture and technology.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>JOHN R. COMMONS.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Commons’ principle of
agreed compromise--what people think rather than what criterion of judgment is
in fact true--led him to view the administrative commission as the American
answer to the major economic problems which have arisen out of the new
technology in combination with corporate organization.  His view was that the
traditional separation of legislative, judicial, and executive functions
rendered our economy helpless when confronted with such problems as monopoly,
public utilities, labor organisation, currency control, investment banking,
taxation, etc.  Problems of this sort require, he thought, agencies which
combine the three functions because we must have a practical method of
“correlating law, economics, and ethics ...”   And his concept of the
correlating function is embodied in his theory of “due process of law” which,
again, is an application of his principle of agreed compromise and, in another
of its applications, constitutes what judicial institutions identify as
“reasonable.”  “Reasonable” is a very important concept in contemporary legal
theory: note ratemaking rules.  According to agreed compromise, findings of commissions
may be held reasonable when all parties affected by the findings are given full
opportunity to present their opinions and intentions and their reasons for
them.  Findings of agreed facts are then held “reasonable” and the courts may
judge interpretations.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Commons took the validity
of compromise as his basic principle because he lacked a rational theory of
value, an evidence-based criterion of judgment.  Thus he arrived at five
“principles of explanation” which determine the complex of transactions:  They
are prescient but amorphous and non-generic. </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            1) efficiency “in terms of
managerial transactions, measured as the <u>rate of output per unit of input,
the man hour</u>.”    Commons viewed this as a relation of man to nature.  He
was never quite clear as to what was put in and what came out.  He finally
decided about what Marshall said: labor and materials went in and commodities
came out.  He found no way to measure both other than utility, despite Veblen’s
fatal attack on it.  But he did think efficiency was determined by
technological aspects of management--use-value in engineering terms.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            2) scarcity “in terms of
bargaining transactions, measured as the<u> rate of proprietary income</u> from
other persons relative to the <u>rate of proprietary outgo</u>, measured by the
dollar.”  Commons viewed this as a relation of man to man.  Without the
instrumental-ceremonial distinction between the functions of institutions, this
is about all he could do--with the added explicit recognition that the sets of
relations are inseparable aspects of the economic process.  Of course both
producing for use and bargaining for scarcity involve man-man relations--the
institutional structure.  Commons thought the two could be harmonized through
collective action resulting in a “reasonable” economy retaining capitalistic
motives.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            3) working rules
(customary behavior) compel individuals.  Contract is not “freedom from
custom;” rather, it is another custom.  It is not rational choices as indicated
by the classicists, but plain custom that determines choices in the market--and
Commons couldn’t explain how customs come about, or even recognize as did
Veblen that that question is the central one in economic theory.  Its answer
must constitute the theory of the economic process.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Commons did feel the
necessity of referential content for his principles, but did not understand the
place of ideas in the determination of “customary behavior.”  He did not even
understand that the significant inquiry is what does determine (bring about)
the complex of behavior patterns.  But we must give him credit for
understanding that institutions are man-made, not natural or imposed by some
outside-of-man guide to man’s destiny.  He makes man responsible.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            4) sovereignty: “the
changing process of authorizing, prohibiting, and regulating the use of
physical force in human affairs.”  What Foster calls mandamus and injunction. 
Its function is to ration factors and commodities in the economic process--the
function accomplished by supply and demand in orthodox theory.  The “rationing
transactions” determine the pattern of economic power.  Commons got
coordination of law and economics, since both have a common effect in terms of
rationing.  But sovereignty works both ways--really through futurity, judging
the future correctly and acting accordingly.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            5) futurity: the dynamic
in the economic process.  Transactions are determined by expectations, as for
Keynes.  But transactions are not repetitive reciprocations within a given
pattern.  There is no “closed” economy; rather there is an ongoing process,
constantly changing.  And therefore the indeterminacy of expectation permits
continuity of the process because it results in different appraisals--and
therefore transactions--which constitute the process.  Shades of Marshall: the
economy works not because of disagreements and institutions, but because
peoples’ expectations differ.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>WESLEY C. MITCHELL.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Mitchell adopted
“pragmatic psychology” from Peirce, Dewey, and Veblen.  His quantitative
analysis provided analytic description more than a catalogue, a systematic
account of what is being inductively investigated.  Problems which are not
subject to quantitative statement may be laid bare by statistical treatment of
historical data, showing the relative importance of various factors which enter
the problem and patterns of fluctuations of those factors.  Statistical
norms--arithmetic mean, modal average, etc.--can reduce the number of
interrelated, concurrently variable functions.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Mitchell said economics
“will be less concerned with puzzles about economic motives and more concerned
about the objective validity of the account it gives of the economic process
...”  Foster says motives are facts in the sequence of events we call the
economic process.  And if motives are in fact a determinant, can we say that we
shall explain the economic process but not consider its determinants?</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Mitchell said that
economics has in common with all other social sciences 1) “the understanding of
human behavior,” 2)” the quantitative analysis of behavior records,” and 3) the
ambition “to devise ways of experimenting upon behavior.”  He understood that
“one who elaborates statistical series in ingenious ways may get as far out of
touch with reality as one who excogitates a set of speculative assumptions.” (“Quantitative
Analysis in Economic Theory.” <u>American Economic Review</u>, 1925)  In the
same essay, he wrote “Qualitative distinctions must remain basic in all their
[economists’] work.”</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            In “The Scope of
Economics,” Mitchell distinguished between evolutionary and systematic
economics.  It is a distinction between theory and practice, parallel to the
distinction between induction and deduction.  He thought--unlike Veblen--that
they should reinforce each other, but that neither could substitute for the
other.  He found economics concerned with four types of inquiries, the first
two of which are objective the last two normative--having to do with welfare.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            1) “the continuous process
of providing and using commodities and services.”</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            2) “the making and
spending of money,” from family budgets to high finance.”</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            3) personal interests--the
“dim inner realm of consciousness,” but somehow</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            excluding motives.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            4) communal interests in
the first two--serviceability to community rather than </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            individual advantage.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>He found that all four fields are
brought into order by money--the integrator--which forces man to be rational,
to make calculable decisions.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Mitchell developed two new
tools for the study of business cycles:</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            1) A new theory of
causation he called “analytical descriptions” applying his distinction between
evolutionary and systematic theory.  Instead of “the cause,” he substituted
“the conditions” which result in fluctuations.  But his “conditions” which
constitute the description are “selective” and “typical.”</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            2) New statistical
techniques to handle the “conditions” at a level of inclusiveness which would
permit their concurrent handling.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Mitchell’s general theory
of the cycle is that each phase contains the “conditions”  strictly within the
market economy which eventuate into the succeeding phase--depression, recovery,
prosperity, recession.  Depression evolves into recovery because stocks of
goods are depleted, population continues to increase, new tastes and styles and
commodities are developed, and investment demand revives.  Recovery merges into
prosperity, in the self-generating sense, until costs and growing tension in
the investment market becomes obstructive.  Recession evolves into depression,
and depression proceeds until goods are depleted.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Mitchell was right in
working with pecuniary accountancy, but he never realized that he was blocked
by the price theory of valuation.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            His eclectic theory of
business cycles presumes that there are cumulative causal factors in each phase
of the cycle that bring about the ensuing phase.  First, in the upswing, there
is a lag in wages (payments to the factors) behind prices. This results in an
opportunity for increasing rates of profits.  However, as this proceeds,
surplus labor is absorbed and the less efficient units are brought into use,
and wages go up in relation to the productivity of the labor purchased. 
Second, the lending capacity of banks is approached, and banks raise the
interest rate.  Third, the prices of raw materials begin to soar, especially as
each raw material approaches its physical limits.  These increases result in a
narrowing of the profit margin, which results in a constriction of banks’
willingness to lend.  Then businessmen make a strong effort to attain liquidity
by selling immediately as many goods as possible.  To do this, they have to
reduce prices.  Reduction in prices makes it more difficult to get liquid, and
it gets worse.  The same cost factors that lagged going up also lag going down.
Sticky prices cause the depression to deepen. This continues until:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            1. The banks get too much “stock” on hand, so
they lower the interest rate. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            2. Wages fall below the immediately past normal
relationship to prices.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            3. This continues until the prices of raw
materials fall sufficiently to enable them to be</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>                used in production profitably, possibly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>Then, Mitchell says, you’re on the upswing again, in view of
the profit margin newly arrived at. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>Thus there is a true cycle inherent in the economy. </span></p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>JOHN MAURICE CLARK.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Clark was uniquely imbued
with received doctrines because his father John Bates Clark was a Neoclassical
theorist--far and away the most able.  But as the son attained maturity, he
came to recognize that something had to be done with the received theory.  He
set out deliberately to find out what that was.  His best treatment of the
ideas which comprise the American contribution are to be seen in <u>Studies in
the Economics of Overhead Costs</u>, published in 1923.  He stated as his
purpose “to come to grips with the dynamic movements and resistances to
movement” which characterize the organic economy in its modern state of
development.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            The son criticized his
father’s concept of capital.  J.B Clark developed the concept of capital as
nonmaterial and immortal.  Capital changes its form from ships to tractors to
sealing wax.  It can be created but never destroyed; it is something central to
civilization itself.  Its physical evidences, like plant and machinery, are
temporal.  But the key to civilization itself is the development and accretion
of the means of providing the means of life--and thereby the quality of life. 
The means of providing the means of life are primarily know-how--the
technological continuum--which is immaterial.   </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            J.B. Clark asked how
capital accrues and what determines its quality?  What determines the character
of production and its level?  His answers were a compelling presentation of the
neo-classical general theory.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            J.M. Clark accepted the
concept of capital as nonmaterial and immortal, but began to notice discrepancies
between the analysis and the run of the facts.  He began his attack with  the
problem of wages, because of their impact on civilization since most people
live from wages.  He found it strange that his father and all teachers in the
world considered wages a cost, since labor is the embodiment of a large part of
human experience itself.  He thought about what it really costs a community to
carry on the economic process, trying to get at what Keynes called user
costs--the only costs to the community at large since all other “costs” to
individuals are really income to the community.  If Clark had started directly
with user costs rather than overhead costs, he probably would have gotten
farther in his analysis.  But he did get beyond prime costs of orthodox analysis--profits,
rents, wages, etc. that constitute income--to some notion of the residual costs
to the community.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Clark recognized that
labor is not a cost in the economic sense.  Inefficient or mistaken use of
labor costs the community, but efficient labor is one of the rewards of life. 
It was thought, for example, that we could produce a lot more goods if people
would just work longer.  The pecuniary accountancy makes it seem that the
community has a choice between leisure and efficiency.  Clark suspected that
this analysis of the labor problem was incorrect.  He started thinking about
the social benefits of maximum hour legislation and minimum wage
legislation--ideas of growing importance.  In textbooks today, authors prove in
their principles chapters that the only way efficiently to organize labor in
relation to other factors of production is through market-driven wage
bargaining.  Then in their problems chapters they propose solutions such as
minimum wages already disproven theoretically. </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Working longer hours means
giving up leisure for the worker, but not for the community where the work
increases rather than decreases alternatives.  Clark suspected that the
Neoclassical theory was wrong to claim that alternative choices of the
community parallel those of the individual.  It is true that if you buy or
produce a recording machine, you cannot  with those funds as an individual, or
with those factors as a producer, buy or produce brief cases.  The choice of
one causes the other not to exist.  By assuming full employment and a
productivity theory of wages, the classicists asserted that a community faces
the same alternatives.  Clark came to the conclusion that the classicists were
wrong, and his thinking here is prescient of the multiplier. In view of the
inclusive character of overhead costs, he recognized that the fact of
depression requires the community to take responsibility for maintaining
aggregate demand.  The fact of depression shows that the free market process
fails to determine the allocation of factors.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Clark’s analysis led him
to conclude that the large amounts of fixed capital prevent the attainment of
equilibrium in the classical sense.  If there weren’t so much fixed capital
which must be paid for, maintaining effective demand would become a minor
problem.  Given our theory of accounting, which comes out of the Neoclassical
economic theory, it is necessarily the case that the period of payment for
fixed capital be shorter than the productive life of that capital.  If asset
life and accounting payments were co-terminal, Clark thought, the community
would not have a problem--reminding one of underconsumption analysis asserting
that you have to withdraw from the stream of effective consumer demand to pay
for fixed capital.  Clark should have rejected that conclusion because his
analysis suggested that raw material and labor are not overhead costs.  Foster
says the trouble is not that the economy cannot attain classical equilibrium;
it is always there, by definition; and we don’t want it--it is beside the
point.  It means commercial efficiency and, as Clark saw, that does not lead to
economic efficiency.  We must replace the price theory of valuation--commercial
efficiency--with the instrumental theory of valuation.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Clark tried to apply the
Veblenian distinction when distinguishing “commercial efficiency” from economic
efficiency, which he called “social values.”  He was trying to get at the
continuing factor Foster calls “value”--the criterion of judgment--but used the
word “values” which are things we hold dear.  They refer to temporary
situations rather than to continuing conditions, and thus cannot serve as
ground for judging what is good and what is bad.  “Social values” are created
by non-market institutions; they may be intangible assets such as a patent
created by legislation.  Market--exchange--values cannot be determined by
alternative utility of the marginal unit because it would destroy the economic
process, as in the case of railroads.  Rather, for Clark, the unit exchange
value comes from the contribution to social value--an offhand acceptance, after
disproving it, that the market process brings exchange value into some kind of
tolerable approximation to social value.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Clark is really saying
that the whole concept of exchange value embraces things created not by some
natural order but rather by institutional adjustment.  They are institutional,
not technological, matters.  He says what ought to determine exchange value is
contribution to the social process.  We need, therefore, a new accounting
system to indicate social values as a parallel check against the business
accounting.  We need an accounting system to show the actual contributions of
any and every economic enterprise.  Clark thus gets closer to a comprehension
of the theory of value, as subsequently expressed by Ayres, than any of his
predecessors.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            What Clark is getting at
under the caption of “variable costs” is identifiable specifically in terms of
institutional inefficiency, and only there.  It is identifiable only in the ceremonial
functions of institutions.  What he calls “overhead costs” Foster says don’t
exist.  But what he is getting at are the real costs that Keynes conceived as
user costs, costs that are experienced anyway.  For example, one could
certainly start off with subsistence as an overhead cost in that
relationship--it is there whether one produces or not.  Beggars who are getting
subsistence are a cost to the community as much as workers receiving a
subsistence wage.  Clark did not realize that cost is a function of value--the
destruction of value.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Clark made the same
mistake as the classical theorists by raising the experience of the individual
to the level of the community.  There are not two kinds of value--personal and
social--but the data are different.  The alternative choices to the individual
are not the same as to the community.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Clark applied the American
philosophical development we used to call modern pragmatism--the word has lost
all meaning now--when he pointed out that wants may be good or bad.  Now in the
neo-classical formulation that is impossible and nonsensical.  It is no concern
of economists whether a want is good or bad.  That judgment is determined by
operations with which  the economist is not and cannot be concerned.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            It has always sort of
amused Foster that scientists who establish the normative-positive dichotomy
insist that, because they are scientists, they can’t carry out other
operations.  They can’t tell the difference between good and bad, but since the
difference exists the rest of the community must tell them.  It makes us look
on scientists as children--naive.  They know many things but are just like
children when it comes to good and bad.  Foster finds this plain silly: what
science is is the study of good and bad.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Clark said that “the goal
of the scientific method is the uncovering of economic truth.”   And the
economic truth includes judgments between good and bad wants.  Thus, economic
analysis involves more than price analysis.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            John Gambs <u>Beyond
Supply and Demand</u> [Columbia University Press, 1946] is simply stating in an
inferior and confused way what Clark had stated twenty years earlier, that the
determinants of the economic process are beyond price theory.  The determinants
lie in the operations that eventuate into decisions regarding good and bad
wants, and the institutional devices for the satisfaction of those wants.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Thus you will find in
Clark a peculiar double play.  When he says that each generation must “discover
anew the essence of economic truth,” he is carrying along the Neoclassical
dichotomy between individual and social problems in trying to apply the
Veblenian distinction.  He is seeking to identify the continuing factors, but
claims that each generation must discover them anew because their structural appearance
changes:</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            Conditions change;
therefore human behavior changes; therefore economic </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            operations change;
therefore there are no continuing factors, and each generation </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            has to learn it over
again.</p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>He says we must discover anew those
things which don’t change, but the immediate emanations of which change.  And
the reason he gets into that paradox is because of this confusion between
personal and social problems.  </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>            But Clark made clear that
the continuing factors cannot be stated in terms of conditions </p>

<p class=Body style='text-align:justify'>or situations.  And their correct
identification permits resolution of the seeming paradox of continuing change
in the presence of continuity.  Resolving that paradox constitutes the American
contribution in economics.</p>
