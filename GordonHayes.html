<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            The inducement to invest is the locus of recent
economic analysis.  Irregularity of capital investment is generally held to be
the <u>real</u> cause of unemployment.  As a consequence of this approach, and
there is sufficient unemployment to maintain remedial action, proposals usually
take the form of direct efforts to induce new capital investment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            Professor Hayes challenges this thesis and its
concomitant policy.  He does not challenge the thesis that employment can be
and is increased through new investment; what he does challenge is the dictum
that failure or irregularity of new capital investment is the <u>real</u> cause
of unemployment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            But, within the market process, the inducement
to extend investment involves the expectation of selling the consumers’ goods
that eventuate from the new capital equipment.  And it is at this point that
insufficiency first makes its appearance.  The very thing that induces new
investment seems to be the thing that is lacking when new investment is
“necessary.”  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>An impasse is apparent.  In this situation investment can
occur in the market process only when investors act otherwise than as “economic
men,” either through ignorance of the deficiency of effective consumer demand
or through determination to invest even though investment cannot be recovered
in the market.  Neither case is characteristic of investors.  Thus incentives
to increase investments cannot arise with the market process.  In that process
the thing that necessitates new investment is the thing that disinclines the
investor toward the purchase of new capital equipment.  Dr. Hayes point out
that government or “social” investment cannot circumvent the impasse if
investment involves self-liquidation in the market.  It is not who does the
investing that creates the difficulty; it is rather the impossibility of
recovering aggregate investment through the market process.  Investment cannot
create the required inducement for its own continuance.  To maintain a given
level of employment, if outright and permanent goals are to be avoided, there
must be production of goods that do not enter the market.  And creation of
these goods must cause, during any time period, as much as the amount of money
income persons and firms seek to accumulate out of the aggregate money income
realized from the given level of employment.,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            The aspect of investment-goods production that
maintains or expands employment is the fact that such goods seldom are
purchased initially out of money income.  Most usually they are purchased with
bank credit.  And the fact that money income is paid out in the production of
capital equipment without the current appearance of equivalent price tags does
help temporarily to fill the gap in purchasing power created by the effort to
accumulate funds.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            Expenditure without the creation of equivalent
price tags is what is necessary.  Consumer-goods purchases satisfy this
necessity; capital-goods purchases do not.  That is why Professor Hayes centers
his attention on the propensity to consume.  Social investments of the
character of roads, parks, schools, hospitals, et cetera, likewise satisfy this
necessity, and that is why considerable attention is paid them. 
Investment-goods production impacts on the market during its creation, as
increased purchasing power; but its appearance and use intensify the difficulty
from which its creation allows temporary relief.  And that is why attempt to
break into the “vicious circle” at the point of investment is not a resolution
of the difficulty.  Reducing the rate of interest cannot induce increased
investment unless there are “fortuitous circumstances” outside the market
process that introduce consumer purchasing power without introducing equivalent
price tags.  To induce investment by reducing the rate of interest, it must be
brought below the marginal efficiency of capital.  Professor Hayes’ whole
demonstration shows that, and this is the crux of the matter, the marginal
efficiency of aggregate capital must be a negative quantity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            To maintain--much less increase--employment, the
constricting circle must be broken.  But where?  At the investment point, the
introduction of new purchasing power nullifies itself because it, during its
life, introduces price tags exceeding the effective purchasing power introduced
by its own creation.  On the other hand, the introduction of new purchasing
power at the consumption point does not nullify itself in this respect; no
price tags are created by an act of purchasing for consumption.  Then it is
here that the constricting circle can be broken, and it is here, therefore,
that analysis of the problem of unemployment should center.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            But to find the point of entry into the problem
does not solve the problem.  The question of how to break in at this point
still remains.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            Private banks can and have created the required
purchasing power.  But this source has two fatal defects.  First, private banks
must expect to be repaid.  Not only this but they must expect to be repaid more
than their creation.  Secondly, private banks can hardly afford to create
directly consumer purchasing power (make loans to consumers).  The first defect
results in the banks setting in motion a series of catastrophic events called
panic.  The second defect forbids the private banking system to introduce new
purchasing power at the only point where the exercise of that power does not
further intensify the impasse on the market.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            The only other funds-creating agency is
government.  The simple fact is that government is the only agency that can
operate continuously at a “loss.”  As the the character of the purchases that
government may make, the question must be settled by deliberate planning and
must be corroborated at the ballot box.  Professor Hayes makes much of this
last point, and thus connects his theory of the level of employment with the
theory of democratic efficiency.  That government must play an increasing role
directly in the economic life of a community is no longer a question.  The only
argument on this point is in respect to the specific character that role shall
take.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal  ><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>            In support of the major thesis presented here,
and for many of its corollaries, Professor Hayes displays much corroborative
evidence and great analytical insight.  Objection may be taken to the choice of
illustrative material or to the manner of presentation and organization, but
the real substance of the argument cannot be avoided.  Particularly great is
his demonstration of the inefficacy of analysis restricted to the inducement to
invest.  But no less could be said of his positive analysis of the tendency
toward depression and of the direction institutional adjustments must take. 
And much more can well be said of his rich insight into the overall problem and
of his warm and sincere concern of a people sorely troubled.</span></p>
